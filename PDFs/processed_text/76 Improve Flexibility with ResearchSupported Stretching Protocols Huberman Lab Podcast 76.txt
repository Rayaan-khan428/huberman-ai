flexibility stretching. talk practices flexibility stretching,
like just highlight features already built nervous system
body allow flexible. us feel tighter others,
sometimes specific limbs areas body, people feel really loose limb,
people even called hyper-flexibility. I, instance, relative
can take fingers bend back point touch wrist.
always makes cringe little bit, can without pain,


seems hyper-flexibility joints. not feature.
may find flexible others naturally, might
thinking don't need build additional flexibility. Well, think end today's
episode, realize almost us can benefit sort
understanding flexibility stretching protocol incorporate
life, not just physical performance reasons postural reasons,
also cognitive mental reasons, sure clarify means.
Right now, like take moment just highlight flexibility already

that? Well, turns aspects nervous system, aspects
skeletal system, aspects muscles, aspects connective tissue

turns set processes

00:09:23 Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range Motion

use trying enhance flexibility stretching. So, like just
take moment review basic elements nervous system, muscle, connective
tissue, skeletal tissue, bone, allow flexibility stretching. can
point two major mechanisms nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve
cells, communicate muscles, muscles communicate back nervous
system make sure limbs don't stretch far, don't move far
get injured. addition that, mechanisms ensure don't
overload muscles much weight, tension, effort damage
way. 'Cause turns second security mechanism making sure
don't overload muscles can leveraged toward increasing flexibility
almost immediately. right, protocols tools share
going allow vastly improve flexibility time. also
mechanisms allow quite significantly increase degree flexibility
short period time, within just seconds. So, establish
basic biological mechanisms. time talk biology physiology, going


talk structure, meaning cells connections, functions,
do. just names understand, not memorize
names. important thing like know flexibility process
stretching getting flexible involves three major components, neural, meaning
nervous system, muscular, muscles, connective tissue. Connective tissue
stuff surrounds neural stuff muscular stuff, although kind
weaved together braided together complicated ways. may
heard fascia. going talk little bit fascia today, although
interesting tissue really deserving episode. Fascial tissue, going
talk stuff surrounds muscles really gives shape,
holds everything together, allows flexibility occur. So, key thing
everyone know whether not talking flexibility not. nervous
system controls muscles, gets muscles contract. So, within
spinal cord, category neurons, nerve cells, called motor neurons.
precise, lower motor neurons 'cause spinal cord. call
lower distinguish motor neurons brain
skull. lower motor neurons, hereafter just refer motor neurons.
want talk kind motor neurons, say upper motor neurons. So,
say motor neurons, just mean ones spinal cord. motor neurons send
little wire set wires muscles, creates called
neuromuscular junction, just means neurons meet muscles
particular place. neurons release chemical, chemical called
acetylcholine. may heard acetylcholine before, acetylcholine
also exists brain things brain, mainly involved focus
attention. neuromuscular junction, release acetylcholine
nerve cells, neurons, onto muscles causes muscles contract.
muscles contract, able move limbs way changing length
muscle, adjusting function connective tissue like tendons ligaments.
instance, bringing wrist closer shoulder, biceps muscle
contracting, getting shorter. mean, reality hasn't gotten shorter overall, just
temporarily shorter, course. controlled neurons. motor
neurons spinal cord really responsible major movement
limbs way causing contraction specific muscles specific times. So, key
thing take away nerve controls contraction muscles. Now, within


muscles themselves, nerve connections. nerve connections
arise different set neurons spinal cord call sensory neurons.
sensory neurons exist different part spinal cord, send low wire
set wires muscles. particular kind sensory neuron comes
spinal cord muscles, called spindle neurons.
create actually wrap around muscle fibers, kind corkscrew around
give kind spring-like appearance. aficionados there,
intrafusal connections neurons. Intrafusal means within muscle, really
don't need know unless really curious it, going become
neuroscientist, medical school something. spindle connections
within muscle wrap around muscle fibers sense stretch muscle
fibers. So, now two parts system described. got motor
neurons can cause muscles contract shorten, spindles
within muscles wrap around muscle fibers, information
sent muscle back spinal cord. form sensing going
muscle. Much way neurons eye sense light
external environment, neurons ear sense sound waves
external environment, neurons spinal cord sensory
neurons sensing amount stretch muscles. happens
given muscle stretching really far, sensory neurons, spindles within
muscle will activate will send electrical potential, literally bit electricity along
wire's length spinal cord. then, within spinal cord sensory
neuron communicates series intermediate steps, motor neuron
makes sure motor neuron contracts. Now, useful? Well,
creates situation muscle stretching much
range motion limb increased much muscle will
contract bring limb range motion safe range again. Now,
determines whether not range motion quote-unquote safe not dictated
number things. dictated things happening kind loop neural
connections spinal cord muscle. also determined going
head, literally mind cognitively whether not movement
limb increasing range motion good you, whether not
deliberately, whether not bad you. also basic safety
mechanisms put really try restrict limb range motion.


Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,
bunch different varieties, well, case, calling spindles sensing
stretch within muscles. given muscle elongating increased
range motion limb, sensory neurons send electrical signal spinal
cord activation motor neuron, now make
perfect sense useful. shortens muscle. actually doesn't
really shorten muscle, contracts muscle brings limb back
safe range motion. Okay, process fast, designed keep
body together safe. designed make sure don't take arm
swing behind torso just goes way back middle back.
mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never

there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not

organs, actually kind feeling, "Hmm, feel great, feel sated, feel
relaxed," different forms interoception. main brain area
associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly

mentioned before, seem uniquely enriched humans, seem

want give practical tool can, course, use, will also give
insight experience muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms. So,
like proper place this, going stand
legs straight, meaning knees not bent, going try touch toes,
going easy might even able put hands
flat floor. don't kind flexibility, pretty easy touch
toes. don't care round back not, although ideally say don't round
back. Not bad necessarily, just try keep
trial trial, were. So, try get sense range motion
terms bending waist maintaining flat back trying touch
toes even touch floor. Maybe, again, can even go hands flat floor
maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like
kicking, although don't quickly, going kick foot, feel


quadriceps contract top thighs. going try
consciously contract hard can. Okay, typically want point
toe back towards knee shin also going help somewhat contract even
harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way
muscles organized muscles antagonistic one
another. So, quadriceps hamstrings work sort push-pull fashion,
will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards
glutes, using hamstring, hamstring obviously also things
related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps
hamstrings, least extent can leverage spindle stretch
mechanisms. So, happens contract quadriceps hard,
relaxing releasing stretch occurring intrafusal spindle
sensory fibers going spinal cord. consequence, able
stretch hamstrings further, can accurate say range
motion hamstring related joints greater aren't engaging
spindle reflex, cause hamstrings contract. Okay,
somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab
elbow move toward midline body using opposite hand. Well,
can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range
motion ability kind lean into, relax into, push stretch, excuse
me, little bit further. Now, physios
backgrounds kinesiology, want acknowledge, course,
mechanisms coming play. actually neural connections within
joints providing proprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.
simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle
mechanisms spent time focusing earlier. indeed, approach can
leveraged toward creating increased limb range motion, not just hamstrings,
quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel
towards glutes. way really trying contract
muscles hard, use deliberate hamstring activation there,
meaning use upper motor neurons aspects
upper brain power, were, try really contract hamstrings intensely
possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,
post-hamstring contraction measure quadricep flexibility, almost
certainly find flexibility increased. Now, course, muscle
really didn't change much, tendons didn't change much. changed
patterns neural activation restricting first case stretching
hamstring a... accurate say certain range
motion hamstring related joints brake mechanisms
removed. And, course, contract hamstring, removing
neural brakes, spindle acting brake inhibiting quadricep range

quadriceps sort simplest place think apply it.
theory and, indeed, practice, really works various muscle groups,

00:42:00 Muscle Anatomy & Cellular ‘Lengthening,’ Range Motion

just sometimes harder access so-called antagonistic muscle groups. Now,


take moment just discuss actually happens get
flexible short-term long-term. just mentioned happens short-term,
clearly don't involve lengthening muscles. not like muscles slide
along bones tendons really stretch much prior
kind exercise. case people stretch consistently given
period several weeks changes muscles. gets little
bit tricky terms nomenclature, just want highlight think
number people get frustrated confused, fact, talk muscles
getting longer. know, whole concept muscle getting longer isn't really
keeping reality, elements within muscles can change
confirmation. So, get little bit detailed here, won't spend much time
this, just want acknowledge interested
neuromuscular physiology relates flexibility. know,
muscle fibers so-called myofibrils. So, can imagine kind
single fiber, fiber, course, will get input motor neurons. within
fibers, called sarcomeres. can kind think
sarcomeres little segments, kind like segments bamboo. ever look
bamboo, not just one big stalk, got little outpouching along way
going break just one big stalk bamboo different
segments, connected. sarcomeres somewhat like that. within
sarcomeres couple different components. One thing called myosin,
like thick layer, actin. interdigitated,
say, kind connected one another, kind like put fingers
together two hands. put fingers one another,
interdigitated, literally interdigitated case, pun intended. myosin
actin kind move relative one another lot ability
contract muscles. stretch muscles, go stretching practice,
number things change, neural, related directly
connective tissue, also appears really nice work mainly done McGill
University, provide link couple studies want dig
deeply, change confirmation, relative size spacing
things like sarcomeres way myosin actin kind work together.
don't want think muscles lengthening, can, however, think resting
state muscle slightly different or, indeed, different resting state


muscle somebody limb not undergone regular flexibility training.
So, much time want spend spend entire
hour getting right details, want emphasize, however,
muscles different parts, fibers, sarcomeres, myosin,
actin. idea making muscles longer, reflects number
processes occur basically within existing muscle length. length muscle
bellies insertions relative connective tissue limbs
genetically determined, right? people have, instance, bicep goes

put arm 90 degree angle put two three fingers

Now, reason mentioned highly detailed cellular mechanisms

00:47:16 Tool: Protocol - Antagonistic Muscles, Pushing vs. Pulling Exercises

related tissues can translate increased range motion performance.
quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes
sets then, course, wouldn't equivalent, rather maintaining
amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.
reason everything describing before,
typically push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well,
sets and, fact, actually sets pushing, pulling
muscles involved chin-ups pull-downs, et cetera, actually
relaxing, least released tension, including activation
spindles among things. So, long-winded way saying interleaving
push pull antagonistic sets can leverage neural circuits


talking leveraging sake increasing flexibility. Now, offer
tool can try. One challenges using tool, however,
often occupy multiple sites within gym. know,
home gym, one thing. gym
multiple pieces equipment, well, become person
essentially taken small corner, multiple corners, machines within
gym. oftentimes, find walk back machine walk back
given resistance exercise someone now taken whole thing
thrown off. So, takes little bit orchestrating order properly.
general, people find can allow enhance performance overall
individual movements, again, maintaining amount rest.
even choose not this, encourage pay attention concept
because, again, leveraging idea antagonistic muscles, flexors extensors,
antagonistic neural relationships spinal cord mechanisms control one
set muscles activating muscles,

00:51:57 Types Stretching: Dynamic, Ballistic, Static & PNF (Proprioceptive

allowing opposite antagonistic muscle relax therefore perform better
next set. So, now like shift question types stretching can
increase limb range motion? goal
efficient way possible 'cause realize people don't endless amounts
time dedicate stretching practice. even us do, sure
want get outcome given effort. modes
stretching going allow us increase flexibility limb range motion
safely? Now, number different types stretching methods
stretching. Broadly defined, can describe dynamic, ballistic, static,
called PNF stretching. PNF stands Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation,
involves leverages many mechanisms described earlier.
first two mentioned, dynamic ballistic stretching, involves
degree momentum, can distinguished static PNF-type stretching.
Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus
element momentum. involve moving limb given range motion,


dynamic stretching, however, tends controlled, less use momentum,
especially towards end range motion. Whereas ballistic stretching, tends
bit swinging limb use momentum. So, invite visualize
dynamic ballistic stretching might look like mind, can even try
safe try it. know, imagine swinging arm overhead
much possible bringing down. seated, kind
ridiculous movement seated perhaps all. instance, can see
dynamic ballistic stretching. Anytime someone, instance, holding onto
something one arm maybe not holding swinging foot,
essentially getting movement hip joint. notice people raise
up, pause it, bring down, one form dynamic stretching. Whereas
others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum
top movement, just let drop back maybe even control
descent. enormous range parameter space variables one
imagine, just simply no way subdivide those.
again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate
force order create movement. Ballistic stretching involving bit
momentum sometimes lot momentum, especially end range
motion. Now, highly distinct static stretching, involves
holding end range motion, minimizing amount momentum used.
So, stay simple example now familiar earlier
discussion, slowly bending waist trying touch toes putting
hands floor holding end position coming slow
controlled way, reduce amount momentum near zero
one example static stretching. Static stretching can subdivided active
passive. Right, different names kinds approaches. can hear
Anderson approach Jander approach, can look sorts things
online. And, again, people tend name things themselves,
proprietary related specific programs, not focusing those. Others come
named physiologists practitioners initially popularize them.
always case, always naming renaming claiming territory

active, dedicated effort part stretcher, you, put force
behind hold kind extend literally extend range motion. then,


also passive static stretching relaxation range

distinguish active passive static stretching. nonetheless, static stretching
involves types elements, active passive, really eliminating

journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray
matter volume particular brain region scales almost linear way
duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,

flexibility stretching. talk practices flexibility stretching,
like just highlight features already built nervous system
body allow flexible. us feel tighter others,
sometimes specific limbs areas body, people feel really loose limb,
people even called hyper-flexibility. I, instance, relative
can take fingers bend back point touch wrist.
always makes cringe little bit, can without pain,


seems hyper-flexibility joints. not feature.
may find flexible others naturally, might
thinking don't need build additional flexibility. Well, think end today's
episode, realize almost us can benefit sort
understanding flexibility stretching protocol incorporate
life, not just physical performance reasons postural reasons,
also cognitive mental reasons, sure clarify means.
Right now, like take moment just highlight flexibility already
have. instance, move arm behind torso little bit
sort let go stop exerting effort that, find limb
return less position next torso, least hope so.
that? Well, turns aspects nervous system, aspects
skeletal system, aspects muscles, aspects connective tissue
binds together, try restore particular order position limbs
limbs relative one another. So, reflects specific set processes
turns set processes

00:09:23 Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range Motion

use trying enhance flexibility stretching. So, like just
take moment review basic elements nervous system, muscle, connective
tissue, skeletal tissue, bone, allow flexibility stretching. can
point two major mechanisms nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve
cells, communicate muscles, muscles communicate back nervous
system make sure limbs don't stretch far, don't move far
get injured. addition that, mechanisms ensure don't
overload muscles much weight, tension, effort damage
way. 'Cause turns second security mechanism making sure
don't overload muscles can leveraged toward increasing flexibility
almost immediately. right, protocols tools share
going allow vastly improve flexibility time. also
mechanisms allow quite significantly increase degree flexibility
short period time, within just seconds. So, establish
basic biological mechanisms. time talk biology physiology, going


talk structure, meaning cells connections, functions,
do. just names understand, not memorize
names. important thing like know flexibility process
stretching getting flexible involves three major components, neural, meaning
nervous system, muscular, muscles, connective tissue. Connective tissue
stuff surrounds neural stuff muscular stuff, although kind
weaved together braided together complicated ways. may
heard fascia. going talk little bit fascia today, although
interesting tissue really deserving episode. Fascial tissue, going
talk stuff surrounds muscles really gives shape,
holds everything together, allows flexibility occur. So, key thing
everyone know whether not talking flexibility not. nervous
system controls muscles, gets muscles contract. So, within
spinal cord, category neurons, nerve cells, called motor neurons.
precise, lower motor neurons 'cause spinal cord. call
lower distinguish motor neurons brain
skull. lower motor neurons, hereafter just refer motor neurons.
want talk kind motor neurons, say upper motor neurons. So,
say motor neurons, just mean ones spinal cord. motor neurons send
little wire set wires muscles, creates called
neuromuscular junction, just means neurons meet muscles
particular place. neurons release chemical, chemical called
acetylcholine. may heard acetylcholine before, acetylcholine
also exists brain things brain, mainly involved focus
attention. neuromuscular junction, release acetylcholine
nerve cells, neurons, onto muscles causes muscles contract.
muscles contract, able move limbs way changing length
muscle, adjusting function connective tissue like tendons ligaments.
instance, bringing wrist closer shoulder, biceps muscle
contracting, getting shorter. mean, reality hasn't gotten shorter overall, just
temporarily shorter, course. controlled neurons. motor
neurons spinal cord really responsible major movement
limbs way causing contraction specific muscles specific times. So, key
thing take away nerve controls contraction muscles. Now, within


muscles themselves, nerve connections. nerve connections
arise different set neurons spinal cord call sensory neurons.
sensory neurons exist different part spinal cord, send low wire
set wires muscles. particular kind sensory neuron comes
spinal cord muscles, called spindle neurons.
create actually wrap around muscle fibers, kind corkscrew around
give kind spring-like appearance. aficionados there,
intrafusal connections neurons. Intrafusal means within muscle, really
don't need know unless really curious it, going become
neuroscientist, medical school something. spindle connections
within muscle wrap around muscle fibers sense stretch muscle
fibers. So, now two parts system described. got motor
neurons can cause muscles contract shorten, spindles
within muscles wrap around muscle fibers, information
sent muscle back spinal cord. form sensing going
muscle. Much way neurons eye sense light
external environment, neurons ear sense sound waves
external environment, neurons spinal cord sensory
neurons sensing amount stretch muscles. happens
given muscle stretching really far, sensory neurons, spindles within
muscle will activate will send electrical potential, literally bit electricity along
wire's length spinal cord. then, within spinal cord sensory
neuron communicates series intermediate steps, motor neuron
makes sure motor neuron contracts. Now, useful? Well,
creates situation muscle stretching much
range motion limb increased much muscle will
contract bring limb range motion safe range again. Now,
determines whether not range motion quote-unquote safe not dictated
number things. dictated things happening kind loop neural
connections spinal cord muscle. also determined going
head, literally mind cognitively whether not movement
limb increasing range motion good you, whether not
deliberately, whether not bad you. also basic safety
mechanisms put really try restrict limb range motion.


Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,
bunch different varieties, well, case, calling spindles sensing
stretch within muscles. given muscle elongating increased
range motion limb, sensory neurons send electrical signal spinal
cord activation motor neuron, now make
perfect sense useful. shortens muscle. actually doesn't
really shorten muscle, contracts muscle brings limb back
safe range motion. Okay, process fast, designed keep
body together safe. designed make sure don't take arm
swing behind torso just goes way back middle back.
mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never
heard of, including neuroscientists there, there, know
there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not
experiencing organ pain discomfort, whether not feel good gut
organs, actually kind feeling, "Hmm, feel great, feel sated, feel
relaxed," different forms interoception. main brain area
associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly
concerned things like smell, extent vision, extent
things arriving external world combining going
internally making sense that, least routing information elsewhere
nervous system make decision, like smell something good approach it,
smell something bad avoid it. front insula really
kind stuff along brain areas. posterior insula, back insula
is, interesting distinct set functions. posterior insula mainly
concerned going somatic experience. feel
internally? movement happen combining
internal state allow feel, like say nervous system mainly batches
things yum, like, "Oh, really good me," yuck, "This really bad
need stop," meh, "This kind neutral." Okay, isn't food,
say stimuli, senses, whether not senses things
internally externally, nervous system trying make decisions
information, mainly batches information yum, want keep
approach thing, continue path movement, eating,
staying temperature environment, et cetera, yuck, need get here, don't
want this, don't want keep this, painful, aversive,
stressful. meh, doesn't really matter, can just kind stay right
not. Yum, yuck, meh. Well, posterior insula, interesting
population large neurons, exceptionally large neurons called von
Economo neurons. neurons are, again, unbeknownst
neuroscientists seem uniquely enriched humans. Chimpanzees
large animals them. So, found whales, chimpanzees,
elephants, humans. even though much smaller whales
even though much smaller elephants, mean, remember
baby elephants. far know, haven't bred like mini-elephants yet,
seem teacup version pretty much every dog breed. can look up,
certainly mixed feelings notion trying downsize everything
point kind like pocket-sized bulldog think someday will arrive.
not fan kind downsizing different breeds, aren't
teacup elephants teacup gorillas, teacup chimpanzees, forth,
species larger us. von Economo neurons


von Economo neurons, upwards 80,000 things
posterior insula. species tend somewhere range 1,000
maybe 10,000 so. interesting? Well, von Economo neurons
unique property integrating knowledge body movements, sense
pain discomfort, can drive motivational processes allow us lean
discomfort and, indeed, overcome discomfort decide discomfort
experiencing good us directed toward specific goal. knowledge
turns important keep mind migrate conversation
toward things can enhance flexibility stretching, soon learn
moments within stretching protocol opportunity
either override pain discomfort kind relax push it. Right,
decision fork road there, it'll tell fork road take,
say, "Uh-uh, not going that. going allow natural reflexes
spindle kick just essentially stop stretching given limb isn't
designed shouldn't stretched far." So, like keep von Economo
neurons mind. mention named von Economo guy,
Constantin von Economo, discovered end 1800s, early 1900s,
decided name himself, many scientists do, certainly neurologists
physicians famous naming things themselves. von Economo
neurons turn important keep mind embark exploration
sorts stretching practices can best applied increase flexibility
whether not undertake mild, moderate, intense flexibility training, will no
doubt encounter scenario point will ask yourself, "Do
quote-unquote relax stretch, try push just little bit
discomfort?" explain gauge decision specific ideally
safe way, give tools will allow make decision way
best preserves integrity neural circuits described earlier can
keep safe. von Economo neurons sit exact position one
want able evaluate going body,

00:30:02 von Economo Neurons, Parasympathetic Activation & Relaxation

particular going terms limb movements, relates feelings
discomfort. aspect von Economo neurons,


von Economo neurons connected number different brain areas
can shift internal state one so-called sympathetic activation. So,
pattern alertness even stress, sometimes even panic, typically alertness
stress one called parasympathetic activation one relaxation. Oftentimes,
hear stretching done relaxing stretch. Well,
actually mean relax stretch? Well, von Economo neurons sit
junction able evaluate going inside body allow us
access neural circuitries can shift relative level alertness bit,
relative level stress bit thereby increase so-called
parasympathetic activation literally override spindle mechanisms,
even GTO mechanisms, especially spindle mechanisms
neuromuscular muscular spinal junction. way, gently, subtly override
reflex otherwise cause us contract muscles back. reason
possible brain kinds motor neurons, upper motor
neurons can direct, meaning control, can override lower motor neurons.
give brief example already done life,
capacity for. referring monosynaptic stretch reflex.
something every first year neuroscience graduate student learns,
step sharp object bare foot, not need make decision
retract foot, automatically provided healthy nervous
system. mechanisms place cause retraction limb way
ensuring proper muscles contract muscles not contract, fact,
fully relax. Okay, case stepping sharp object like piece glass,
nail, tack, essentially activate hip flexor lift foot
quickly possible. so, neural circuit activate contralateral,
meaning opposite side body circuit, ensure leg, foot not
stepping sharp object exactly opposite extend make
sure don't fall over. happens reflexively, not require
thought decision making. fact, humans without neocortex, literally
decerebrate animal doesn't have... say decerebrate, mean lack
cerebral cortex. can perform controlled circuits
basically brain spinal cord. little bit activation circuits
kind deeper parts brain, basically don't need think decide
order that. However, life depended walking across sharp objects,


say. make little less dramatic not like "Die Hard" movie
something run barefoot across glass, although pretty good
example describing here, say walk across hot
stones get away something wanted avoid. override

screaming, "Don't this, don't this, don't this," shuttle information
brain areas allow override reflex essentially push

all. So, von Economo neurons sit important junction within brain.
pay attention going body, pain, pleasure, et cetera.
includes going limbs limb range motion. also
paying attention can control amount activation, kind alertness calmness
able create within body response given sensory experience.
mentioned before, seem uniquely enriched humans, seem
related aspects evolution allow us make decisions
body ways animals just simply can't. go further,
want give practical tool can, course, use, will also give
insight experience muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms. So,
like proper place this, going stand
legs straight, meaning knees not bent, going try touch toes,
going easy might even able put hands
flat floor. don't kind flexibility, pretty easy touch
toes. don't care round back not, although ideally say don't round
back. Not bad necessarily, just try keep
trial trial, were. So, try get sense range motion
terms bending waist maintaining flat back trying touch
toes even touch floor. Maybe, again, can even go hands flat floor
maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like
kicking, although don't quickly, going kick foot, feel


quadriceps contract top thighs. going try
consciously contract hard can. Okay, typically want point
toe back towards knee shin also going help somewhat contract even
harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way
muscles organized muscles antagonistic one
another. So, quadriceps hamstrings work sort push-pull fashion,
will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards
glutes, using hamstring, hamstring obviously also things
related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps
hamstrings, least extent can leverage spindle stretch
mechanisms. So, happens contract quadriceps hard,
relaxing releasing stretch occurring intrafusal spindle
sensory fibers going spinal cord. consequence, able
stretch hamstrings further, can accurate say range
motion hamstring related joints greater aren't engaging
spindle reflex, cause hamstrings contract. Okay,
somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab
elbow move toward midline body using opposite hand. Well,
can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range
motion ability kind lean into, relax into, push stretch, excuse
me, little bit further. Now, physios
backgrounds kinesiology, want acknowledge, course,
mechanisms coming play. actually neural connections within
joints providing proprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.
simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle
mechanisms spent time focusing earlier. indeed, approach can
leveraged toward creating increased limb range motion, not just hamstrings,
quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel
towards glutes. way really trying contract
muscles hard, use deliberate hamstring activation there,
meaning use upper motor neurons aspects
upper brain power, were, try really contract hamstrings intensely
possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,
post-hamstring contraction measure quadricep flexibility, almost
certainly find flexibility increased. Now, course, muscle
really didn't change much, tendons didn't change much. changed
patterns neural activation restricting first case stretching
hamstring a... accurate say certain range
motion hamstring related joints brake mechanisms
removed. And, course, contract hamstring, removing
neural brakes, spindle acting brake inhibiting quadricep range
motion. Okay, can imagine this, fact can apply number
different muscles, larger muscles sort biceps, triceps, hamstrings,
quadriceps sort simplest place think apply it.
theory and, indeed, practice, really works various muscle groups,

00:42:00 Muscle Anatomy & Cellular ‘Lengthening,’ Range Motion

just sometimes harder access so-called antagonistic muscle groups. Now,


take moment just discuss actually happens get
flexible short-term long-term. just mentioned happens short-term,
clearly don't involve lengthening muscles. not like muscles slide
along bones tendons really stretch much prior
kind exercise. case people stretch consistently given
period several weeks changes muscles. gets little
bit tricky terms nomenclature, just want highlight think
number people get frustrated confused, fact, talk muscles
getting longer. know, whole concept muscle getting longer isn't really
keeping reality, elements within muscles can change
confirmation. So, get little bit detailed here, won't spend much time
this, just want acknowledge interested
neuromuscular physiology relates flexibility. know,
muscle fibers so-called myofibrils. So, can imagine kind
single fiber, fiber, course, will get input motor neurons. within
fibers, called sarcomeres. can kind think
sarcomeres little segments, kind like segments bamboo. ever look
bamboo, not just one big stalk, got little outpouching along way
going break just one big stalk bamboo different
segments, connected. sarcomeres somewhat like that. within
sarcomeres couple different components. One thing called myosin,
like thick layer, actin. interdigitated,
say, kind connected one another, kind like put fingers
together two hands. put fingers one another,
interdigitated, literally interdigitated case, pun intended. myosin
actin kind move relative one another lot ability
contract muscles. stretch muscles, go stretching practice,
number things change, neural, related directly
connective tissue, also appears really nice work mainly done McGill
University, provide link couple studies want dig
deeply, change confirmation, relative size spacing
things like sarcomeres way myosin actin kind work together.
don't want think muscles lengthening, can, however, think resting
state muscle slightly different or, indeed, different resting state


muscle somebody limb not undergone regular flexibility training.
So, much time want spend spend entire
hour getting right details, want emphasize, however,
muscles different parts, fibers, sarcomeres, myosin,
actin. idea making muscles longer, reflects number
processes occur basically within existing muscle length. length muscle
bellies insertions relative connective tissue limbs
genetically determined, right? people have, instance, bicep goes
way crook elbow shoulder, right? people can
put arm 90 degree angle put two three fingers
bicep elbow. have, can say, shorter bicep, relatively shorter.
Now, reason mentioned highly detailed cellular mechanisms
start embark different protocols using stretching increase flexibility
range motion, need ask preventing ability extend range
motion? spindle, right? muscle stretching much?
Oftentimes, can and/or sense pain simply
sense muscle not position unrelated pain
spindle activation. oftentimes, can related directly changes
confirmation myosin actin, within context sarcomeres. Now,

want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal

instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us

consider whether not within given training session want static

training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,

thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability

excuse me, will provide link study can peruse detail


like. Now, related somewhat final point, like return idea
place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray

duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,

also cognitive mental reasons, sure clarify means.
Right now, like take moment just highlight flexibility already

00:09:23 Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range Motion

use trying enhance flexibility stretching. So, like just
take moment review basic elements nervous system, muscle, connective
tissue, skeletal tissue, bone, allow flexibility stretching. can
point two major mechanisms nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve
cells, communicate muscles, muscles communicate back nervous
system make sure limbs don't stretch far, don't move far
get injured. addition that, mechanisms ensure don't
overload muscles much weight, tension, effort damage
way. 'Cause turns second security mechanism making sure
don't overload muscles can leveraged toward increasing flexibility
almost immediately. right, protocols tools share
going allow vastly improve flexibility time. also
mechanisms allow quite significantly increase degree flexibility
short period time, within just seconds. So, establish
basic biological mechanisms. time talk biology physiology, going


talk structure, meaning cells connections, functions,
do. just names understand, not memorize
names. important thing like know flexibility process
stretching getting flexible involves three major components, neural, meaning
nervous system, muscular, muscles, connective tissue. Connective tissue
stuff surrounds neural stuff muscular stuff, although kind
weaved together braided together complicated ways. may
heard fascia. going talk little bit fascia today, although
interesting tissue really deserving episode. Fascial tissue, going
talk stuff surrounds muscles really gives shape,
holds everything together, allows flexibility occur. So, key thing
everyone know whether not talking flexibility not. nervous
system controls muscles, gets muscles contract. So, within
spinal cord, category neurons, nerve cells, called motor neurons.
precise, lower motor neurons 'cause spinal cord. call
lower distinguish motor neurons brain
skull. lower motor neurons, hereafter just refer motor neurons.
want talk kind motor neurons, say upper motor neurons. So,
say motor neurons, just mean ones spinal cord. motor neurons send
little wire set wires muscles, creates called
neuromuscular junction, just means neurons meet muscles
particular place. neurons release chemical, chemical called
acetylcholine. may heard acetylcholine before, acetylcholine
also exists brain things brain, mainly involved focus
attention. neuromuscular junction, release acetylcholine
nerve cells, neurons, onto muscles causes muscles contract.
muscles contract, able move limbs way changing length
muscle, adjusting function connective tissue like tendons ligaments.
instance, bringing wrist closer shoulder, biceps muscle
contracting, getting shorter. mean, reality hasn't gotten shorter overall, just
temporarily shorter, course. controlled neurons. motor
neurons spinal cord really responsible major movement
limbs way causing contraction specific muscles specific times. So, key
thing take away nerve controls contraction muscles. Now, within


muscles themselves, nerve connections. nerve connections
arise different set neurons spinal cord call sensory neurons.
sensory neurons exist different part spinal cord, send low wire
set wires muscles. particular kind sensory neuron comes
spinal cord muscles, called spindle neurons.
create actually wrap around muscle fibers, kind corkscrew around
give kind spring-like appearance. aficionados there,
intrafusal connections neurons. Intrafusal means within muscle, really
don't need know unless really curious it, going become
neuroscientist, medical school something. spindle connections
within muscle wrap around muscle fibers sense stretch muscle
fibers. So, now two parts system described. got motor
neurons can cause muscles contract shorten, spindles
within muscles wrap around muscle fibers, information
sent muscle back spinal cord. form sensing going
muscle. Much way neurons eye sense light
external environment, neurons ear sense sound waves
external environment, neurons spinal cord sensory
neurons sensing amount stretch muscles. happens
given muscle stretching really far, sensory neurons, spindles within
muscle will activate will send electrical potential, literally bit electricity along
wire's length spinal cord. then, within spinal cord sensory
neuron communicates series intermediate steps, motor neuron
makes sure motor neuron contracts. Now, useful? Well,
creates situation muscle stretching much
range motion limb increased much muscle will
contract bring limb range motion safe range again. Now,
determines whether not range motion quote-unquote safe not dictated
number things. dictated things happening kind loop neural
connections spinal cord muscle. also determined going
head, literally mind cognitively whether not movement
limb increasing range motion good you, whether not
deliberately, whether not bad you. also basic safety
mechanisms put really try restrict limb range motion.


Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,
bunch different varieties, well, case, calling spindles sensing
stretch within muscles. given muscle elongating increased
range motion limb, sensory neurons send electrical signal spinal
cord activation motor neuron, now make
perfect sense useful. shortens muscle. actually doesn't
really shorten muscle, contracts muscle brings limb back
safe range motion. Okay, process fast, designed keep
body together safe. designed make sure don't take arm
swing behind torso just goes way back middle back.
mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never
heard of, including neuroscientists there, there, know
there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not
experiencing organ pain discomfort, whether not feel good gut
organs, actually kind feeling, "Hmm, feel great, feel sated, feel
relaxed," different forms interoception. main brain area
associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly
concerned things like smell, extent vision, extent
things arriving external world combining going
internally making sense that, least routing information elsewhere
nervous system make decision, like smell something good approach it,
smell something bad avoid it. front insula really
kind stuff along brain areas. posterior insula, back insula
is, interesting distinct set functions. posterior insula mainly
concerned going somatic experience. feel
internally? movement happen combining
internal state allow feel, like say nervous system mainly batches
things yum, like, "Oh, really good me," yuck, "This really bad
need stop," meh, "This kind neutral." Okay, isn't food,
say stimuli, senses, whether not senses things
internally externally, nervous system trying make decisions
information, mainly batches information yum, want keep
approach thing, continue path movement, eating,
staying temperature environment, et cetera, yuck, need get here, don't
want this, don't want keep this, painful, aversive,
stressful. meh, doesn't really matter, can just kind stay right
not. Yum, yuck, meh. Well, posterior insula, interesting
population large neurons, exceptionally large neurons called von
Economo neurons. neurons are, again, unbeknownst
neuroscientists seem uniquely enriched humans. Chimpanzees
large animals them. So, found whales, chimpanzees,
elephants, humans. even though much smaller whales
even though much smaller elephants, mean, remember
baby elephants. far know, haven't bred like mini-elephants yet,
seem teacup version pretty much every dog breed. can look up,
certainly mixed feelings notion trying downsize everything
point kind like pocket-sized bulldog think someday will arrive.
not fan kind downsizing different breeds, aren't
teacup elephants teacup gorillas, teacup chimpanzees, forth,
species larger us. von Economo neurons


von Economo neurons, upwards 80,000 things
posterior insula. species tend somewhere range 1,000
maybe 10,000 so. interesting? Well, von Economo neurons
unique property integrating knowledge body movements, sense
pain discomfort, can drive motivational processes allow us lean
discomfort and, indeed, overcome discomfort decide discomfort
experiencing good us directed toward specific goal. knowledge
turns important keep mind migrate conversation
toward things can enhance flexibility stretching, soon learn
moments within stretching protocol opportunity
either override pain discomfort kind relax push it. Right,
decision fork road there, it'll tell fork road take,
say, "Uh-uh, not going that. going allow natural reflexes
spindle kick just essentially stop stretching given limb isn't
designed shouldn't stretched far." So, like keep von Economo
neurons mind. mention named von Economo guy,
Constantin von Economo, discovered end 1800s, early 1900s,
decided name himself, many scientists do, certainly neurologists
physicians famous naming things themselves. von Economo
neurons turn important keep mind embark exploration
sorts stretching practices can best applied increase flexibility
whether not undertake mild, moderate, intense flexibility training, will no
doubt encounter scenario point will ask yourself, "Do
quote-unquote relax stretch, try push just little bit
discomfort?" explain gauge decision specific ideally
safe way, give tools will allow make decision way
best preserves integrity neural circuits described earlier can
keep safe. von Economo neurons sit exact position one
want able evaluate going body,

00:30:02 von Economo Neurons, Parasympathetic Activation & Relaxation

particular going terms limb movements, relates feelings
discomfort. aspect von Economo neurons,


von Economo neurons connected number different brain areas
can shift internal state one so-called sympathetic activation. So,
pattern alertness even stress, sometimes even panic, typically alertness
stress one called parasympathetic activation one relaxation. Oftentimes,
hear stretching done relaxing stretch. Well,
actually mean relax stretch? Well, von Economo neurons sit
junction able evaluate going inside body allow us
access neural circuitries can shift relative level alertness bit,
relative level stress bit thereby increase so-called
parasympathetic activation literally override spindle mechanisms,
even GTO mechanisms, especially spindle mechanisms
neuromuscular muscular spinal junction. way, gently, subtly override
reflex otherwise cause us contract muscles back. reason
possible brain kinds motor neurons, upper motor
neurons can direct, meaning control, can override lower motor neurons.
give brief example already done life,
capacity for. referring monosynaptic stretch reflex.
something every first year neuroscience graduate student learns,
step sharp object bare foot, not need make decision
retract foot, automatically provided healthy nervous

meaning opposite side body circuit, ensure leg, foot not
stepping sharp object exactly opposite extend make
sure don't fall over. happens reflexively, not require
thought decision making. fact, humans without neocortex, literally
decerebrate animal doesn't have... say decerebrate, mean lack
cerebral cortex. can perform controlled circuits
basically brain spinal cord. little bit activation circuits
kind deeper parts brain, basically don't need think decide
order that. However, life depended walking across sharp objects,


say. make little less dramatic not like "Die Hard" movie
something run barefoot across glass, although pretty good
example describing here, say walk across hot

pay attention going body, pain, pleasure, et cetera.
includes going limbs limb range motion. also
paying attention can control amount activation, kind alertness calmness
able create within body response given sensory experience.
mentioned before, seem uniquely enriched humans, seem
related aspects evolution allow us make decisions
body ways animals just simply can't. go further,
want give practical tool can, course, use, will also give
insight experience muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms. So,
like proper place this, going stand
legs straight, meaning knees not bent, going try touch toes,
going easy might even able put hands
flat floor. don't kind flexibility, pretty easy touch
toes. don't care round back not, although ideally say don't round
back. Not bad necessarily, just try keep
trial trial, were. So, try get sense range motion
terms bending waist maintaining flat back trying touch
toes even touch floor. Maybe, again, can even go hands flat floor
maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like
kicking, although don't quickly, going kick foot, feel


quadriceps contract top thighs. going try
consciously contract hard can. Okay, typically want point
toe back towards knee shin also going help somewhat contract even
harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way
muscles organized muscles antagonistic one
another. So, quadriceps hamstrings work sort push-pull fashion,
will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards
glutes, using hamstring, hamstring obviously also things
related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps

Typically, find often called straight sets,

eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put
it? push stretch? even want balance tiny bit?
want reach end point try extend within given set
session? reason, excited find paper entitled Comparison
Two Stretching Modalities Lower-Limb Range Motion Measurements
Recreational Dancers. Happens done recreational dancers, six-week
intervention program compared low-intensity stretching, call
Microstretching. used capital M, don't know means proprietary,
although didn't see evidence conflict interest, call Microstretching.
clear, Microstretching case manuscript low-intensity stretching.
compared moderate intensity static stretching active
passive ranges motion. Okay, lot different variables here,
just highlight things really relevant us, give
take away outset return end lose
attention next couple minutes, least key take away. Basically,
found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity
static stretching. find incredibly interesting, low intensity, define
means moment. Here, quoting them, "The interesting aspect


study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near
pain. according study least, operating performing stretching
intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower
one pushing pain zone, speak. authors offer number
different explanations approach, Microstretching approach, might
effective. Here, paraphrasing discussion mentioned
hypothesized improved reciprocal inhibition within hamstring
muscle group. So, gets right back sorts neural mechanisms talked
before, somehow low-intensity stretching able
access spindle GTO-type mechanisms referring


earlier, inhibition hamstring quadricep stretches. also offer
number different ideas shift activation so-called
sympathetic, remember kind stress division nervous system, reduce
relative activation parasympathetic arm nervous system. confess,
couple arguments around sympathetic, parasympathetic
somewhat convoluted. will just fairness neuroscience systems,
wouldn't suggest putting much weight arguments sympathetic
parasympathetic. mind, didn't really hold much water, not trying
disparaging overall work, think really quite sound, low
intensity, called Microstretching,

01:41:33 Tool: Stretch Exercises?

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck
put specific numbers people follow order
ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability
relax access deep relaxation quickly, well even reduce inflammation


perhaps even combat certain forms cancer. sounds really far-fetched,
want emphasize study share moment actually
carried one directors division National Institutes Health.
work Helene Langevin, medical doctor, done really important
work mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture approached

Langevin currently Director National Institutes Complementary Health
Medicine National Institutes Health. So, major division supported tax
dollars support systematic mechanistic exploration things like respiration,
meditation, yoga, acupuncture. So, serious science applied protocols
approaches used period time, really aimed trying
understand best protocols evolve new protocols? So,
really interesting study done animal models, think powerful enough result
think pay attention it. title paper, and, again, last
author Dr. Langevin herself, Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth Mouse Breast

Dr. Langevin others shown just brief whole body stretch sort

indeed stretching induces relaxation systemic level, not just local level.
think important, probably not surprising use stretching

01:51:37 Insula & Discomfort, Pain Tolerance & Yoga

excuse me, will provide link study can peruse detail


like. Now, related somewhat final point, like return idea
place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray
matter volume particular brain region scales almost linear way
duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,
stress management will much better,

talk structure, meaning cells connections, functions,
do. just names understand, not memorize
names. important thing like know flexibility process
stretching getting flexible involves three major components, neural, meaning
nervous system, muscular, muscles, connective tissue. Connective tissue
stuff surrounds neural stuff muscular stuff, although kind
weaved together braided together complicated ways. may
heard fascia. going talk little bit fascia today, although
interesting tissue really deserving episode. Fascial tissue, going
talk stuff surrounds muscles really gives shape,
holds everything together, allows flexibility occur. So, key thing
everyone know whether not talking flexibility not. nervous
system controls muscles, gets muscles contract. So, within
spinal cord, category neurons, nerve cells, called motor neurons.
precise, lower motor neurons 'cause spinal cord. call
lower distinguish motor neurons brain
skull. lower motor neurons, hereafter just refer motor neurons.
want talk kind motor neurons, say upper motor neurons. So,
say motor neurons, just mean ones spinal cord. motor neurons send
little wire set wires muscles, creates called
neuromuscular junction, just means neurons meet muscles
particular place. neurons release chemical, chemical called
acetylcholine. may heard acetylcholine before, acetylcholine
also exists brain things brain, mainly involved focus
attention. neuromuscular junction, release acetylcholine
nerve cells, neurons, onto muscles causes muscles contract.
muscles contract, able move limbs way changing length
muscle, adjusting function connective tissue like tendons ligaments.
instance, bringing wrist closer shoulder, biceps muscle
contracting, getting shorter. mean, reality hasn't gotten shorter overall, just
temporarily shorter, course. controlled neurons. motor
neurons spinal cord really responsible major movement
limbs way causing contraction specific muscles specific times. So, key
thing take away nerve controls contraction muscles. Now, within


muscles themselves, nerve connections. nerve connections
arise different set neurons spinal cord call sensory neurons.
sensory neurons exist different part spinal cord, send low wire
set wires muscles. particular kind sensory neuron comes
spinal cord muscles, called spindle neurons.
create actually wrap around muscle fibers, kind corkscrew around
give kind spring-like appearance. aficionados there,
intrafusal connections neurons. Intrafusal means within muscle, really
don't need know unless really curious it, going become
neuroscientist, medical school something. spindle connections
within muscle wrap around muscle fibers sense stretch muscle
fibers. So, now two parts system described. got motor
neurons can cause muscles contract shorten, spindles
within muscles wrap around muscle fibers, information
sent muscle back spinal cord. form sensing going
muscle. Much way neurons eye sense light
external environment, neurons ear sense sound waves
external environment, neurons spinal cord sensory
neurons sensing amount stretch muscles. happens
given muscle stretching really far, sensory neurons, spindles within
muscle will activate will send electrical potential, literally bit electricity along
wire's length spinal cord. then, within spinal cord sensory
neuron communicates series intermediate steps, motor neuron
makes sure motor neuron contracts. Now, useful? Well,
creates situation muscle stretching much
range motion limb increased much muscle will
contract bring limb range motion safe range again. Now,
determines whether not range motion quote-unquote safe not dictated
number things. dictated things happening kind loop neural
connections spinal cord muscle. also determined going
head, literally mind cognitively whether not movement
limb increasing range motion good you, whether not
deliberately, whether not bad you. also basic safety
mechanisms put really try restrict limb range motion.


Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,
bunch different varieties, well, case, calling spindles sensing
stretch within muscles. given muscle elongating increased
range motion limb, sensory neurons send electrical signal spinal
cord activation motor neuron, now make
perfect sense useful. shortens muscle. actually doesn't
really shorten muscle, contracts muscle brings limb back
safe range motion. Okay, process fast, designed keep
body together safe. designed make sure don't take arm
swing behind torso just goes way back middle back.
mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never
heard of, including neuroscientists there, there, know
there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not
experiencing organ pain discomfort, whether not feel good gut
organs, actually kind feeling, "Hmm, feel great, feel sated, feel
relaxed," different forms interoception. main brain area
associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly
concerned things like smell, extent vision, extent
things arriving external world combining going
internally making sense that, least routing information elsewhere
nervous system make decision, like smell something good approach it,
smell something bad avoid it. front insula really
kind stuff along brain areas. posterior insula, back insula
is, interesting distinct set functions. posterior insula mainly
concerned going somatic experience. feel
internally? movement happen combining
internal state allow feel, like say nervous system mainly batches
things yum, like, "Oh, really good me," yuck, "This really bad
need stop," meh, "This kind neutral." Okay, isn't food,
say stimuli, senses, whether not senses things
internally externally, nervous system trying make decisions
information, mainly batches information yum, want keep
approach thing, continue path movement, eating,
staying temperature environment, et cetera, yuck, need get here, don't
want this, don't want keep this, painful, aversive,
stressful. meh, doesn't really matter, can just kind stay right
not. Yum, yuck, meh. Well, posterior insula, interesting
population large neurons, exceptionally large neurons called von
Economo neurons. neurons are, again, unbeknownst
neuroscientists seem uniquely enriched humans. Chimpanzees
large animals them. So, found whales, chimpanzees,
elephants, humans. even though much smaller whales
even though much smaller elephants, mean, remember
baby elephants. far know, haven't bred like mini-elephants yet,
seem teacup version pretty much every dog breed. can look up,
certainly mixed feelings notion trying downsize everything

species larger us. von Economo neurons


von Economo neurons, upwards 80,000 things
posterior insula. species tend somewhere range 1,000
maybe 10,000 so. interesting? Well, von Economo neurons
unique property integrating knowledge body movements, sense
pain discomfort, can drive motivational processes allow us lean
discomfort and, indeed, overcome discomfort decide discomfort
experiencing good us directed toward specific goal. knowledge
turns important keep mind migrate conversation
toward things can enhance flexibility stretching, soon learn
moments within stretching protocol opportunity
either override pain discomfort kind relax push it. Right,
decision fork road there, it'll tell fork road take,
say, "Uh-uh, not going that. going allow natural reflexes
spindle kick just essentially stop stretching given limb isn't
designed shouldn't stretched far." So, like keep von Economo
neurons mind. mention named von Economo guy,
Constantin von Economo, discovered end 1800s, early 1900s,
decided name himself, many scientists do, certainly neurologists
physicians famous naming things themselves. von Economo
neurons turn important keep mind embark exploration
sorts stretching practices can best applied increase flexibility
whether not undertake mild, moderate, intense flexibility training, will no
doubt encounter scenario point will ask yourself, "Do
quote-unquote relax stretch, try push just little bit
discomfort?" explain gauge decision specific ideally
safe way, give tools will allow make decision way
best preserves integrity neural circuits described earlier can
keep safe. von Economo neurons sit exact position one
want able evaluate going body,

von Economo neurons connected number different brain areas

actually mean relax stretch? Well, von Economo neurons sit

So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,

Typically, find often called straight sets,

eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

means not increasing total rest time four minutes

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate

called Anderson method, around long time. Actually never met

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put
it? push stretch? even want balance tiny bit?
want reach end point try extend within given set

compared moderate intensity static stretching active

just highlight things really relevant us, give
take away outset return end lose
attention next couple minutes, least key take away. Basically,
found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity
static stretching. find incredibly interesting, low intensity, define
means moment. Here, quoting them, "The interesting aspect


study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near
pain. according study least, operating performing stretching
intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower
one pushing pain zone, speak. authors offer number
different explanations approach, Microstretching approach, might

earlier, inhibition hamstring quadricep stretches. also offer
number different ideas shift activation so-called

01:41:33 Tool: Stretch Exercises?

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck
put specific numbers people follow order
ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability

excuse me, will provide link study can peruse detail


like. Now, related somewhat final point, like return idea
place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray

duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,

create actually wrap around muscle fibers, kind corkscrew around
give kind spring-like appearance. aficionados there,
intrafusal connections neurons. Intrafusal means within muscle, really
don't need know unless really curious it, going become
neuroscientist, medical school something. spindle connections

within muscles wrap around muscle fibers, information
sent muscle back spinal cord. form sensing going

external environment, neurons ear sense sound waves
external environment, neurons spinal cord sensory
neurons sensing amount stretch muscles. happens
given muscle stretching really far, sensory neurons, spindles within
muscle will activate will send electrical potential, literally bit electricity along
wire's length spinal cord. then, within spinal cord sensory

makes sure motor neuron contracts. Now, useful? Well,
creates situation muscle stretching much

Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,

mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never

there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not

associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly
concerned things like smell, extent vision, extent
things arriving external world combining going
internally making sense that, least routing information elsewhere
nervous system make decision, like smell something good approach it,
smell something bad avoid it. front insula really
kind stuff along brain areas. posterior insula, back insula
is, interesting distinct set functions. posterior insula mainly
concerned going somatic experience. feel
internally? movement happen combining
internal state allow feel, like say nervous system mainly batches

Typically, find often called straight sets,

eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

means not increasing total rest time four minutes

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put

want reach end point try extend within given set

just highlight things really relevant us, give

found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity

means moment. Here, quoting them, "The interesting aspect


study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near

intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore

can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking

reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability

place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von

forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people

yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind

increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas

going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship

like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability

greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility

course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things

no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.

Okay, just clarify, whole thing looks like loop, essential components
loop motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons,
bunch different varieties, well, case, calling spindles sensing
stretch within muscles. given muscle elongating increased
range motion limb, sensory neurons send electrical signal spinal
cord activation motor neuron, now make
perfect sense useful. shortens muscle. actually doesn't
really shorten muscle, contracts muscle brings limb back
safe range motion. Okay, process fast, designed keep
body together safe. designed make sure don't take arm
swing behind torso just goes way back middle back.
mean, unless contortionist trained kind level flexibility,
terrible provide lot damage muscles,
connective tissue, forth. So, one basic mechanism want hold
mind,

00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms

idea spindle senses stretch can activate contraction muscles
shorten muscles. next mechanism want describe,
two need hold mind episode. mechanism lot
features one just described, less stretch, fact,
doesn't stretch much sensing loads. So,
end muscles tendons typically, neurons closely
associated tendons called Golgi tendon organs, right?
neurons sensory neurons sense much load given muscle.
Right, lifting something very, heavy, neurons going fire,
meaning going send electrical activity spinal cord. then,
neurons ability shut down, not activate, shut motor neurons
prevent contraction given muscle. So, instance, walk
try pick weight much heavy you, meaning not
without injuring start try heave weight off ground.
number reasons might not able lift it, say start get
little bit off ground, start get force generated allow


move. force generating potentially rip muscles
tendons off bone, right, disrupt joints tear ligaments.
Well, safety mechanism place, Golgi tendon organs,
GTOs, called, get activated shut motor neurons make
impossible muscles contract. Okay, one hand,
mechanism senses stretch can figure stretch excessive.
system detects stretch excessive, activates contraction muscles.
then, second mechanism senses loads, tension loads
deemed excessive circuits, remember circuits don't mind,
don't go, "Oh, excessive," just sense loads. loads
exceed certain threshold, well GTOs, Golgi tendon organs, send
signals spinal cord shut motor neuron's ability contract muscle
no longer can lift heavy load. So, protective
mechanisms, can leveraged logical way

00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging

safe way order increase limb range motion. So,
couple things want point going little bit nervous
system controls flexibility stretching, key points following.
now dozens not hundreds studies show dedicated stretching practice
can improve limb range motion. Now, many listening, probably
saying, "Duh," think important point out, dedicated stretching
practice can increase limb range motion. soon learn, specific
mechanisms can explain effect. second point one longevity.
say longevity, don't necessarily mean late-stage aging. undergo decrease
limb range motion, unless something offset decrease. current
numbers vary study study, look en masse, look
studies basically find start experience decrease flexibility
age 20 age 49 pretty dramatic. then, course, will
continue age 49, basically 10% decrease every 10 years. So,
say 1% decrease per year, although not necessarily linear. mean
that? Well, not necessarily 21st birthday, 1% less flexible
20th birthday decreased 1% per year,


changes can non-linear. So, can imagine person just fine
terms flexibility 20 30, get 32 suddenly lost
5% flexibility. Now, course, will ton lifestyle factors.
regular practitioner yoga, dedicated stretching practice,
things improve muscle contractibility, resistance training
turns can actually indirectly improve flexibility. number different
factors, key point maintaining degree flexibility maybe even
enhancing range motion flexibility immense benefit offsetting injury
provided not pushed far. number people pushed
limb range motion far experience sorts injuries,

00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice

acute chronic injuries. Today, also talk avoid
scenarios. Okay, established mechanisms within spinal cord,
muscles, connective tissue, remember motor neurons, spindles,
GTOs, and, course, muscles themselves, connective tissue, tendons,
also forms connective tissue establish whether not limb going stay
within particular range motion not, whether not limb going
allowed nervous system pursue handle given load, given tension.
also mechanisms arrive neuromuscular system higher
nervous system, brain. mechanisms involve couple different
facets really interesting, think know about. fact, today,
going teach set neurons guessing 99.9% never
heard of, including neuroscientists there, there, know
there, seem uniquely enriched humans probably perform essential roles
ability regulate physiology emotional state. So, within brain,
ability sense things external world, something called exteroception,
ability sense things internal world within body, called
interoception. Interoception can volume food gut, whether not
experiencing organ pain discomfort, whether not feel good gut
organs, actually kind feeling, "Hmm, feel great, feel sated, feel
relaxed," different forms interoception. main brain area
associated interpreting going body called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.


interesting brain region, got two major parts. front mainly
concerned things like smell, extent vision, extent
things arriving external world combining going
internally making sense that, least routing information elsewhere
nervous system make decision, like smell something good approach it,
smell something bad avoid it. front insula really
kind stuff along brain areas. posterior insula, back insula
is, interesting distinct set functions. posterior insula mainly
concerned going somatic experience. feel
internally? movement happen combining
internal state allow feel, like say nervous system mainly batches
things yum, like, "Oh, really good me," yuck, "This really bad
need stop," meh, "This kind neutral." Okay, isn't food,
say stimuli, senses, whether not senses things
internally externally, nervous system trying make decisions

von Economo neurons, upwards 80,000 things
posterior insula. species tend somewhere range 1,000
maybe 10,000 so. interesting? Well, von Economo neurons
unique property integrating knowledge body movements, sense
pain discomfort, can drive motivational processes allow us lean

decision fork road there, it'll tell fork road take,
say, "Uh-uh, not going that. going allow natural reflexes
spindle kick just essentially stop stretching given limb isn't

Typically, find often called straight sets,

eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

means not increasing total rest time four minutes

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put

want reach end point try extend within given set

just highlight things really relevant us, give

found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity

study greater increase active range motion compared passive range

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain

think us able register within ourselves, whether given range

intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching

probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static

training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion

can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking

reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability

didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people

yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even

significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,

increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas

remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental

much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility

no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion

Typically, find often called straight sets,

eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

means not increasing total rest time four minutes

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put

just highlight things really relevant us, give

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push

think us able register within ourselves, whether given range

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static

training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore

can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking

didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people

yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even

significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,

So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,

contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps

somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part

thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab

can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep

opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20

quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance

you, may found you, say, three sets pushing

machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes

amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put
it? push stretch? even want balance tiny bit?
want reach end point try extend within given set

compared moderate intensity static stretching active

just highlight things really relevant us, give
take away outset return end lose

found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity
static stretching. find incredibly interesting, low intensity, define
means moment. Here, quoting them, "The interesting aspect


study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near

want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal

instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting

consider whether not within given training session want static

dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,

terms bending waist maintaining flat back trying touch
toes even touch floor. Maybe, again, can even go hands flat floor
maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like
kicking, although don't quickly, going kick foot, feel


quadriceps contract top thighs. going try

toe back towards knee shin also going help somewhat contract even
harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way
muscles organized muscles antagonistic one
another. So, quadriceps hamstrings work sort push-pull fashion,
will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards
glutes, using hamstring, hamstring obviously also things
related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps
hamstrings, least extent can leverage spindle stretch
mechanisms. So, happens contract quadriceps hard,
relaxing releasing stretch occurring intrafusal spindle
sensory fibers going spinal cord. consequence, able
stretch hamstrings further, can accurate say range

spindle reflex, cause hamstrings contract. Okay,
somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab
elbow move toward midline body using opposite hand. Well,
can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range
motion ability kind lean into, relax into, push stretch, excuse
me, little bit further. Now, physios
backgrounds kinesiology, want acknowledge, course,
mechanisms coming play. actually neural connections within
joints providing proprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.
simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle
mechanisms spent time focusing earlier. indeed, approach can
leveraged toward creating increased limb range motion, not just hamstrings,
quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel
towards glutes. way really trying contract
muscles hard, use deliberate hamstring activation there,
meaning use upper motor neurons aspects
upper brain power, were, try really contract hamstrings intensely
possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,
post-hamstring contraction measure quadricep flexibility, almost
certainly find flexibility increased. Now, course, muscle

even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going

instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective

great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within

forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,

didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people

yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even

significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind

increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas

maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15

harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way

will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards

related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps

mechanisms. So, happens contract quadriceps hard,
relaxing releasing stretch occurring intrafusal spindle

stretch hamstrings further, can accurate say range

somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab
elbow move toward midline body using opposite hand. Well,
can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range

me, little bit further. Now, physios

simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle

leveraged toward creating increased limb range motion, not just hamstrings,
quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel

muscles hard, use deliberate hamstring activation there,
meaning use upper motor neurons aspects

take moment just discuss actually happens get

kind exercise. case people stretch consistently given
period several weeks changes muscles. gets little
bit tricky terms nomenclature, just want highlight think
number people get frustrated confused, fact, talk muscles
getting longer. know, whole concept muscle getting longer isn't really
keeping reality, elements within muscles can change

this, just want acknowledge interested
neuromuscular physiology relates flexibility. know,
muscle fibers so-called myofibrils. So, can imagine kind

fibers, called sarcomeres. can kind think
sarcomeres little segments, kind like segments bamboo. ever look
bamboo, not just one big stalk, got little outpouching along way
going break just one big stalk bamboo different
segments, connected. sarcomeres somewhat like that. within
sarcomeres couple different components. One thing called myosin,
like thick layer, actin. interdigitated,
say, kind connected one another, kind like put fingers

deeply, change confirmation, relative size spacing
things like sarcomeres way myosin actin kind work together.
don't want think muscles lengthening, can, however, think resting

muscle somebody limb not undergone regular flexibility training.
So, much time want spend spend entire

muscles different parts, fibers, sarcomeres, myosin,

related tissues can translate increased range motion performance.
quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes
sets then, course, wouldn't equivalent, rather maintaining
amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.
reason everything describing before,
typically push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well,
sets and, fact, actually sets pushing, pulling
muscles involved chin-ups pull-downs, et cetera, actually
relaxing, least released tension, including activation
spindles among things. So, long-winded way saying interleaving
push pull antagonistic sets can leverage neural circuits


talking leveraging sake increasing flexibility. Now, offer

thrown off. So, takes little bit orchestrating order properly.
general, people find can allow enhance performance overall
individual movements, again, maintaining amount rest.
even choose not this, encourage pay attention concept
because, again, leveraging idea antagonistic muscles, flexors extensors,
antagonistic neural relationships spinal cord mechanisms control one
set muscles activating muscles,

00:51:57 Types Stretching: Dynamic, Ballistic, Static & PNF (Proprioceptive

allowing opposite antagonistic muscle relax therefore perform better
next set. So, now like shift question types stretching can

efficient way possible 'cause realize people don't endless amounts
time dedicate stretching practice. even us do, sure
want get outcome given effort. modes
stretching going allow us increase flexibility limb range motion
safely? Now, number different types stretching methods
stretching. Broadly defined, can describe dynamic, ballistic, static,
called PNF stretching. PNF stands Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation,
involves leverages many mechanisms described earlier.
first two mentioned, dynamic ballistic stretching, involves
degree momentum, can distinguished static PNF-type stretching.
Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus
element momentum. involve moving limb given range motion,


dynamic stretching, however, tends controlled, less use momentum,
especially towards end range motion. Whereas ballistic stretching, tends
bit swinging limb use momentum. So, invite visualize
dynamic ballistic stretching might look like mind, can even try
safe try it. know, imagine swinging arm overhead
much possible bringing down. seated, kind
ridiculous movement seated perhaps all. instance, can see
dynamic ballistic stretching. Anytime someone, instance, holding onto
something one arm maybe not holding swinging foot,
essentially getting movement hip joint. notice people raise
up, pause it, bring down, one form dynamic stretching. Whereas
others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum
top movement, just let drop back maybe even control
descent. enormous range parameter space variables one
imagine, just simply no way subdivide those.
again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate
force order create movement. Ballistic stretching involving bit
momentum sometimes lot momentum, especially end range
motion. Now, highly distinct static stretching, involves
holding end range motion, minimizing amount momentum used.
So, stay simple example now familiar earlier
discussion, slowly bending waist trying touch toes putting
hands floor holding end position coming slow

place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von

not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine

Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make

pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray

like proper place this, going stand

terms bending waist maintaining flat back trying touch
toes even touch floor. Maybe, again, can even go hands flat floor
maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like

quadriceps contract top thighs. going try

harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way

somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part

thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab

can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range

simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle

quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel

possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,

So, much time want spend spend entire

quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes
sets then, course, wouldn't equivalent, rather maintaining
amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.
reason everything describing before,
typically push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well,
sets and, fact, actually sets pushing, pulling
muscles involved chin-ups pull-downs, et cetera, actually
relaxing, least released tension, including activation

safely? Now, number different types stretching methods
stretching. Broadly defined, can describe dynamic, ballistic, static,
called PNF stretching. PNF stands Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation,
involves leverages many mechanisms described earlier.
first two mentioned, dynamic ballistic stretching, involves
degree momentum, can distinguished static PNF-type stretching.
Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus
element momentum. involve moving limb given range motion,


dynamic stretching, however, tends controlled, less use momentum,
especially towards end range motion. Whereas ballistic stretching, tends
bit swinging limb use momentum. So, invite visualize
dynamic ballistic stretching might look like mind, can even try
safe try it. know, imagine swinging arm overhead
much possible bringing down. seated, kind
ridiculous movement seated perhaps all. instance, can see
dynamic ballistic stretching. Anytime someone, instance, holding onto
something one arm maybe not holding swinging foot,
essentially getting movement hip joint. notice people raise
up, pause it, bring down, one form dynamic stretching. Whereas
others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum
top movement, just let drop back maybe even control
descent. enormous range parameter space variables one
imagine, just simply no way subdivide those.
again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate
force order create movement. Ballistic stretching involving bit
momentum sometimes lot momentum, especially end range
motion. Now, highly distinct static stretching, involves
holding end range motion, minimizing amount momentum used.
So, stay simple example now familiar earlier
discussion, slowly bending waist trying touch toes putting
hands floor holding end position coming slow

dynamic ballistic stretching can immensely useful improving

Although, make additional point static stretching might even

stretches applied least five minutes per week." Okay,
critical. not five minutes per stretch. Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch,
least five minutes per week. Whereas time spent stretching within single
session not seem significant effect range motion gains.
getting confusing, make sure soon understand exactly can export
conclusions. data indicated performing stretching least five days

Okay, five days per week, lot, least five minutes per week, five minutes

01:17:12 Tool: Warming & Stretching

Three sets 30 seconds holds done five times maybe even six times per week.

course, kinds protocols, likely not just

so, entire session going take time, five days week pretty

going minimum five minutes per week elicit significant response

compare flexibility training to, say, resistance training strength hypertrophy.

Dr. Andy Galpin probably agree provided one trains hard enough

maybe even far front you. Okay, now like stand back
like contract quadriceps hard possibly can 5-15
seconds. say 10 seconds just keep things less normalized.
obviously not super controlled experiment. So, contract quadriceps
don't know, going extend lower limb out. So, like
kicking, although don't quickly, going kick foot, feel


quadriceps contract top thighs. going try

harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way
muscles organized muscles antagonistic one

will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards

related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps

somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab

can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range

simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle

quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel

possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,

sarcomeres couple different components. One thing called myosin,

things like sarcomeres way myosin actin kind work together.
don't want think muscles lengthening, can, however, think resting

So, much time want spend spend entire

related tissues can translate increased range motion performance.
quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes
sets then, course, wouldn't equivalent, rather maintaining
amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.
reason everything describing before,
typically push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well,
sets and, fact, actually sets pushing, pulling
muscles involved chin-ups pull-downs, et cetera, actually
relaxing, least released tension, including activation
spindles among things. So, long-winded way saying interleaving
push pull antagonistic sets can leverage neural circuits


talking leveraging sake increasing flexibility. Now, offer

efficient way possible 'cause realize people don't endless amounts

want get outcome given effort. modes
stretching going allow us increase flexibility limb range motion
safely? Now, number different types stretching methods
stretching. Broadly defined, can describe dynamic, ballistic, static,
called PNF stretching. PNF stands Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation,
involves leverages many mechanisms described earlier.
first two mentioned, dynamic ballistic stretching, involves
degree momentum, can distinguished static PNF-type stretching.
Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus
element momentum. involve moving limb given range motion,


dynamic stretching, however, tends controlled, less use momentum,
especially towards end range motion. Whereas ballistic stretching, tends
bit swinging limb use momentum. So, invite visualize
dynamic ballistic stretching might look like mind, can even try
safe try it. know, imagine swinging arm overhead
much possible bringing down. seated, kind
ridiculous movement seated perhaps all. instance, can see
dynamic ballistic stretching. Anytime someone, instance, holding onto
something one arm maybe not holding swinging foot,
essentially getting movement hip joint. notice people raise
up, pause it, bring down, one form dynamic stretching. Whereas
others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum
top movement, just let drop back maybe even control
descent. enormous range parameter space variables one
imagine, just simply no way subdivide those.
again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate
force order create movement. Ballistic stretching involving bit
momentum sometimes lot momentum, especially end range
motion. Now, highly distinct static stretching, involves
holding end range motion, minimizing amount momentum used.
So, stay simple example now familiar earlier
discussion, slowly bending waist trying touch toes putting
hands floor holding end position coming slow

one example static stretching. Static stretching can subdivided active

So, specific exercises target specific muscle groups aside, now established

dynamic ballistic stretching can immensely useful improving
performance specific movements, particular, context particular sports like
tennis, sprinting, frankly sport, carry certain amount
risk use momentum. So, don't need highly trained order
perform them. fact, place will describe one want
apply dynamic ballistic stretching. just give away now, think physios

certainly not saying, want repeat, certainly not saying dynamic

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety

going reach toes, range motion might adjusted

basically define end range motion place can feel stretch

focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels

advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,

purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching

mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60

think us able register within ourselves, whether given range

want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching

even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going

consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective

great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal

harder harder. Okay, so, 10 seconds. lot will just
standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, release it, now go
ahead repeat stretch trying touch toes touch floor.
So, is, again, relying less hamstring flexibility among things. Okay,
will find immediate increase hamstring flexibility,
range motion increased. didn't experience that,
encourage try contract quadriceps harder longer, maybe 20
30 seconds, try so-called experiment again. contracting
quadriceps allow hamstring flexibility suddenly increase? Well, way

will. can antagonize one another, move heel towards

related hip movement. lift knee extend foot
contract quadriceps, essentially relaxing hamstrings. Now, course,
movements involve quadricep hamstring synchrony.
synchrony really elegant one, less isolating quadriceps
hamstrings, least extent can leverage spindle stretch
mechanisms. So, happens contract quadriceps hard,
relaxing releasing stretch occurring intrafusal spindle
sensory fibers going spinal cord. consequence, able
stretch hamstrings further, can accurate say range

spindle reflex, cause hamstrings contract. Okay,
somebody tight hamstrings, variety reasons that, part
reason likely neural can release neural spindle reflex
contracting opposite antagonistic muscle, case quadriceps.
thing true can leveraged stretching muscles. So, instance,
going tricep stretch, typical kind overhead grab
elbow move toward midline body using opposite hand. Well,
can that, suggest trying flex bicep, contract bicep


is, that. people notice increase tricep range
motion ability kind lean into, relax into, push stretch, excuse
me, little bit further. Now, physios
backgrounds kinesiology, want acknowledge, course,
mechanisms coming play. actually neural connections within
joints providing proprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.
simply illustrate part range motion determined spindle
mechanisms spent time focusing earlier. indeed, approach can
leveraged toward creating increased limb range motion, not just hamstrings,
quadriceps. So, instance, tight quadriceps, can
opposite. can contract hamstring intensely say 10 seconds, 20
seconds, 30 seconds. So, take conscious effort bringing heel
towards glutes. way really trying contract
muscles hard, use deliberate hamstring activation there,
meaning use upper motor neurons aspects
upper brain power, were, try really contract hamstrings intensely
possible, relax that, quadricep stretch again.
pre-hamstring contraction measurement quadricep flexibility,
post-hamstring contraction measure quadricep flexibility, almost
certainly find flexibility increased. Now, course, muscle

So, much time want spend spend entire

quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat

means not increasing total rest time four minutes

quick relevant aside, thought share something useful also
grounded notion antagonistic muscles. So, resistance
training, whether not body weight, physical weights, machines,
you, may found you, say, three sets pushing


exercise, pushups, bench presses, shoulder
presses, something sort. then, later workout do, say,
machine pull-downs, pull-ups, chin-ups sort, pulling exercise.
Typically, find often called straight sets,
three sets pushups, say, two minutes rest
might able get certain number repetitions first set. just
sake example, say can get 10 repetitions first set, get
eight repetitions second set, get six repetitions third set
two minutes between, move point pulling
exercises. similarly, say chin-ups pull-downs
get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic
one another. So, case, pushing chest, shoulders, triceps
pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds
perform pulling set, go back pushing set, go back pulling set,
push, pull, push, pull, words, interleaving sets. Even
maintain amount rest sets pushing sets pulling,
discover often drop number repetitions get somewhat
offset. So, rather get 10, 8, 6, straight sets, will 10, 9, 8. So,
means not increasing total rest time four minutes
sets then, course, wouldn't equivalent, rather maintaining
amount rest sets muscle group, going push,
pull, push, pull antagonistic muscles, able improved performance.
reason everything describing before,
typically push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well,

first two mentioned, dynamic ballistic stretching, involves

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

dynamic stretching, however, tends controlled, less use momentum,
especially towards end range motion. Whereas ballistic stretching, tends

others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum

again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate

So, stay simple example now familiar earlier

Dr. Andy Galpin probably agree provided one trains hard enough

get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes, six
repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically people discover interleave
pushing pulling exercises, provided muscles antagonistic

pushing exercises, pulling back biceps, and, course,
muscles involved well. muscle groups least part
antagonistic one another, people often find to, say,
pushing set, get 10 repetitions, move pulling set just say 60 seconds

Now, distinguish dynamic stretching ballistic stretching, like focus

others will swing sort let carry bit due momentum

again, dynamic ballistic stretching involve movement, generate

even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going

thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective

session not seem significant effect range motion gains.
getting confusing, make sure soon understand exactly can export

Okay, five days per week, lot, least five minutes per week, five minutes

so, entire session going take time, five days week pretty

even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going

getting confusing, make sure soon understand exactly can export

Okay, five days per week, lot, least five minutes per week, five minutes

compare flexibility training to, say, resistance training strength hypertrophy.

Dr. Andy Galpin probably agree provided one trains hard enough

even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going

thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective

compromising use greater loads greatly offset static

course, kinds protocols, likely not just

so, entire session going take time, five days week pretty

however, gave greatest degree gains limb range motion. average,
saw 20.9% increase, increases observed also
quite substantial. So, ballistic stretching can also provide pretty impressive limb

point out, 11.65% increase, case PNF, 15% increase. So, appears
greatest improvements limb range motion time spent effort spent
going minimum five minutes per week elicit significant response
five days minimum weekly recommended frequency achieve significant
range motion improvements. confess, pretty surprising
compare flexibility training to, say, resistance training strength hypertrophy.
experience, know people experience, think
Dr. Andy Galpin probably agree provided one trains hard enough
appropriately don't need train resistance training five days week order
get significant improvements strength hypertrophy. people might need to,
can get lot positive results variables less frequent training,
certainly three four days week training. cardiovascular training,
not aware anyone tested whether not one long run week can
actually increase cardiovascular fitness not anything else. Although,
imagine probably see improvement compared not anything,
people repeated training sessions cardiovascular strength training.
Not lot people five days week strength training, least aware
of. people are, people think not. people five
days week cardiovascular training. guessing people not
five days week dedicated static stretch range motion directed training,
appear frequency week getting repeated sessions, even
short individual muscle group, turns important. so,
points perhaps reason people dedicated range motion

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch
relevant muscle groups. think important unlike resistance training
cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put
it? push stretch? even want balance tiny bit?
want reach end point try extend within given set

just highlight things really relevant us, give

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push

think us able register within ourselves, whether given range

01:41:33 Tool: Stretch Exercises?

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck

ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking

reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability

Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck
put specific numbers people follow order
ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, “Micro-Stretching”

think much keeping study describe next,
emphasizes yes, stretch end range motion, not
focus much range motion happens day. So, instance,
not thinking, "Oh, can always touch toes, instance. therefore
starting place flexibility training today." rather take entirety
system account day understand that, okay, provided warmed
appropriately, now going stretch hamstrings, instance,
going reach toes, range motion might adjusted
day way tension stress, way ambient temperature room.
basically define end range motion place can feel stretch

cardiovascular training, can measure distance traveled time case
cardiovascular training, much weight bar, count repetitions, et
cetera. range motion training, course, range motion feature
interested in, likely lot variation day-to-day based
number different internal external factors. so, Anderson method really
getting static forms stretching. think today mainly
focusing static stretching holding end range motion, really paying
attention feel stretch muscles involved. parallels
resistance cardiovascular training realize, right? case trying build
hypertrophy, say improve hypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes best
advice one can give don't try lift weights, rather challenge muscles.
Now, course, need provide adequate loads order get hypertrophy,
training purely strength, moving weights. training


purely hypertrophy mainly hypertrophy, really challenging muscles
using weights forms resistance. similarly, keeping
Anderson method, trying build limb range motion, static stretching
place difficult, can experience stretch muscle
cognitively, consciously able focus muscles stretch least
useful evaluating current range motion able achieve. So,
mean? means feel muscles stretch them, don't just go
motions. means don't get attached able always achieve,
instance, stretch given distance within given session. might actually find
just finding place can't get much holding static
stretch there, second third set happen day,
range motion will increased considerably. Maybe not, likely yes,
will. And, course, evaluating range motion time key parameter
goal type work. Now, along lines, variable
mentioned times passive versus active stretching, even
nebulous variable, even kind subjective thing much effort put
it? push stretch? even want balance tiny bit?
want reach end point try extend within given set

just highlight things really relevant us, give

found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity

study greater increase active range motion compared passive range

moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near
pain. according study least, operating performing stretching
intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower
one pushing pain zone, speak. authors offer number
different explanations approach, Microstretching approach, might

01:41:33 Tool: Stretch Exercises?

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck
put specific numbers people follow order
ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability
relax access deep relaxation quickly, well even reduce inflammation


perhaps even combat certain forms cancer. sounds really far-fetched,

compared moderate intensity static stretching active
passive ranges motion. Okay, lot different variables here,
just highlight things really relevant us, give
take away outset return end lose
attention next couple minutes, least key take away. Basically,
found six-week training program using low-intensity stretching
greater positive effect lower limb range motion moderate-intensity
static stretching. find incredibly interesting, low intensity, define
means moment. Here, quoting them, "The interesting aspect


study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near
pain. according study least, operating performing stretching
intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower
one pushing pain zone, speak. authors offer number
different explanations approach, Microstretching approach, might
effective. Here, paraphrasing discussion mentioned
hypothesized improved reciprocal inhibition within hamstring

want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal

instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting

consider whether not within given training session want static

dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking

forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people

yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even

significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make

pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray

greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility

study greater increase active range motion compared passive range
motion Microstretching group." So, relates just talking
moments ago relates Anderson method, low-
intensity stretching, meaning effort feels not painful fact might even feel easy
least not straining exceed given range motion turns not just
effective, effective moderate-intensity stretching. So, low-intensity
static stretching? Well, define stretches completed intensity
30-40% 100% equals point pain, right? So, 30-40% individuals,
again, paraphrasing, induced relaxed state within individual
specific muscle. holding static stretches mention
one minute, not 30 seconds. Now, control group exact overall
protocol, daily stretching six weeks, exercises, holding set 60
seconds, using intensity stretch 80% where, again, 100 represents
point pain point person want stop stretching. find
data incredibly interesting for, think, obvious reasons. going
embark flexibility stretching training program, don't need push
point pain. fact, seems even just approaching point pain going
less effective operating 30-40% intensity prior reaching pain
threshold. pain threshold 100%. Now, course, pretty subjective,
think us able register within ourselves, whether given range
motion extending given range motion brings us threshold pain near
pain. according study least, operating performing stretching
intensity quite low, relaxing turns beneficial increasing
range motion exercises aimed increasing range motion higher
intensity. Okay, lower intensity stretching, say lower intensity static stretching
appears beneficial way approach stretching. think relief
probably many us also suggests injury risk going lower
one pushing pain zone, speak. authors offer number
different explanations approach, Microstretching approach, might
effective. Here, paraphrasing discussion mentioned
hypothesized improved reciprocal inhibition within hamstring
muscle group. So, gets right back sorts neural mechanisms talked
before, somehow low-intensity stretching able
access spindle GTO-type mechanisms referring


earlier, inhibition hamstring quadricep stretches. also offer
number different ideas shift activation so-called
sympathetic, remember kind stress division nervous system, reduce
relative activation parasympathetic arm nervous system. confess,
couple arguments around sympathetic, parasympathetic
somewhat convoluted. will just fairness neuroscience systems,
wouldn't suggest putting much weight arguments sympathetic
parasympathetic. mind, didn't really hold much water, not trying
disparaging overall work, think really quite sound, low
intensity, called Microstretching,

01:41:33 Tool: Stretch Exercises?

going effective way increase limb range movement time.
want just briefly return idea whether not ballistic static stretching
sort skill training, weight training, kind sport, even
cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, data really split there.
even folks suggest kind stretching prior running going
lower running efficiency, going require essentially work oxygen
uptake given speed variety reasons, runners community argue
endlessly. papers sides, directions, sure hear
comments. not really going take stance
consequence data place. However, think general
logic can apply, borrowing conversations
information put Dr. Andy Galpin, think is, course, expert
thinks things really sound flexible way, no pun intended.
instances, example, individual might want static stretching
increase limb range motion prior weight training even going inhibit
person's ability lift much weight. want that? Well,
instance, somebody tightness limitation neuromuscular connective
tissue system someplace body system prevents using proper
form, can overcome static stretching. Well,
great idea Dr. Galpin points out. instance, proper stability within
movement requires increasing limb range motion way, well


compromising use greater loads greatly offset static
stretching improve, say, hamstring flexibility another muscle group flexibility. So,
can't always think just going allow us inhibit us using maximal
amount weight running far want run fast want run.
instances people trying overcome injuries trying
come back repetitive surgery something sort, coming back layoff
additional static stretching prior cardiovascular, weight training, skill
training, sport kind going useful going put us
position greater safety confidence performance overall, even adjusting
speed total amount loads use. So, needs
consider whether not within given training session want static
training, say static stretching range motion training prior
training session. similarly, lot data pointing fact
dynamic even ballistic stretching prior skill training, cardiovascular, weight
training can beneficial part warm-up relevant neural circuits, joints,
connective tissue, muscles, well perhaps improve range motion
ability perform movements accurately, stability, therefore
confidence. Dr. Andy Galpin never name protocol
himself, far humble that, named couple protocols him,
particularly Galpin equation hydration, willing stick neck
put specific numbers people follow order
ensure proper hydration training, can look Galpin equation elsewhere.
can just Google look elsewhere find it. Dr. Galpin also
thoughtful generous, think accurate offering kind general
organizational logic think goals particular training session,
thereby decide whether not going ballistic, static stretching,
forth. So, can refer general approach Galpinian.

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability
relax access deep relaxation quickly, well even reduce inflammation


perhaps even combat certain forms cancer. sounds really far-fetched,
want emphasize study share moment actually
carried one directors division National Institutes Health.
work Helene Langevin, medical doctor, done really important
work mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture approached
mechanistic viewpoint. Right, not looking just effects
acupuncture, really trying understand sorts cytokines, inflammatory
molecules, pathways activated? sorts neural mechanisms get engaged
things like acupuncture impinges fascial tissues forth? Dr.
Langevin currently Director National Institutes Complementary Health
Medicine National Institutes Health. So, major division supported tax
dollars support systematic mechanistic exploration things like respiration,
meditation, yoga, acupuncture. So, serious science applied protocols
approaches used period time, really aimed trying
understand best protocols evolve new protocols? So,
really interesting study done animal models, think powerful enough result
think pay attention it. title paper, and, again, last
author Dr. Langevin herself, Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth Mouse Breast
Cancer Model. yes, can get mice stretch, turns gently lift
mice tail hold onto cage, way can
mechanically stretch way doesn't harm them. First, mention
Dr. Langevin others shown just brief whole body stretch sort
induces increase activation parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous
system, again, not arm, limb arm, aspect autonomic nervous system
creates whole body, whole nervous system shift toward relaxation. So, yes,
indeed stretching induces relaxation systemic level, not just local level.
think important, probably not surprising use stretching
regularly, yes, indeed relax us. Yes, can mice see
mice well. current study, say study
published 2018 Scientific Reports. write, "Recent studies shown
gentle daily stretching 10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue inflammation
fibrosis." Now, local tissue inflammation fibrosis well now know
systemic inflammation can induce relaxation systemically. case, focused
mice, not humans. mice randomized stretch versus no stretch


condition treated 10 minutes day four weeks. So, 10 minutes
passive whole body stretching day four weeks. remarkable, mean,
just say just striking tumor volume mice, able
induce tumors mice tumor volume end point 52% smaller
stretch group compared no stretch group. highly significant effect,
point absence treatment. explored whether
not cytotoxic immune responses activated number features.
weren't able get deeply underlying mechanisms, pretty
remarkable. Even three weeks stretching protocol, daily stretching protocol
mice tumor volume reduced, mean, almost halved, pretty
incredible. So, measures tumor volume difference
way animals treated handled introduction daily stretch.
find result be, course, limited extent done animal model,
not humans, point out, point discussion, "Our
results demonstrate 52% reduction mammary tumor growth one month mice
undergoing stretching 10 minutes day without form therapy."
think stretching changing tumor size? No, fact raise possibility
stretching impact fascia might even create micro environments
permissive tumor growth certain instances, careful
emphasize also believe case, unlikely stretching
directly acting reduce tumor size, rather possible link
inflammation immune exhaustion mechanisms can periodically
relax nervous system, stretching, can affect certain pathways
related immune system allow immune system combat tumor
growth significant degree. So, again, even though study mice, argues
relaxation induced stretching can powerful influence mammary tumor
growth. Again, huge effect carried one premier labs individuals

excuse me, will provide link study can peruse detail


like. Now, related somewhat final point, like return idea
place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray
matter volume particular brain region scales almost linear way
duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,

intensity, 30-40% one consider painful appears
effective 80% threshold. find incredibly interesting. then,
idea frequency, really appear getting least five minutes per week
total stretching given muscle group important creating meaningful, lasting
changes limb range motion. best achieved five day week, six day
week, even seven day week protocols, can short protocols
limited to, say, three sets 30, maybe 45 60 seconds static hold. Although, 30
seconds seems key threshold can get maximum benefit.
no need full 60-second holds unless fewer total sessions per week.
And, course, always warm-up arrive stretching session warm. then,
course, forms stretching touched upon bit, things like

01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease

Galpinian, right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, talking
stretching sake increasing limb flexibility range motion,
reasons perhaps embark stretching protocol include ability
relax access deep relaxation quickly, well even reduce inflammation


perhaps even combat certain forms cancer. sounds really far-fetched,
want emphasize study share moment actually
carried one directors division National Institutes Health.
work Helene Langevin, medical doctor, done really important
work mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture approached
mechanistic viewpoint. Right, not looking just effects
acupuncture, really trying understand sorts cytokines, inflammatory
molecules, pathways activated? sorts neural mechanisms get engaged
things like acupuncture impinges fascial tissues forth? Dr.
Langevin currently Director National Institutes Complementary Health
Medicine National Institutes Health. So, major division supported tax
dollars support systematic mechanistic exploration things like respiration,
meditation, yoga, acupuncture. So, serious science applied protocols
approaches used period time, really aimed trying
understand best protocols evolve new protocols? So,
really interesting study done animal models, think powerful enough result
think pay attention it. title paper, and, again, last
author Dr. Langevin herself, Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth Mouse Breast
Cancer Model. yes, can get mice stretch, turns gently lift
mice tail hold onto cage, way can
mechanically stretch way doesn't harm them. First, mention
Dr. Langevin others shown just brief whole body stretch sort
induces increase activation parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous
system, again, not arm, limb arm, aspect autonomic nervous system
creates whole body, whole nervous system shift toward relaxation. So, yes,
indeed stretching induces relaxation systemic level, not just local level.
think important, probably not surprising use stretching
regularly, yes, indeed relax us. Yes, can mice see
mice well. current study, say study
published 2018 Scientific Reports. write, "Recent studies shown
gentle daily stretching 10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue inflammation

remarkable. Even three weeks stretching protocol, daily stretching protocol
mice tumor volume reduced, mean, almost halved, pretty
incredible. So, measures tumor volume difference
way animals treated handled introduction daily stretch.
find result be, course, limited extent done animal model,

like. Now, related somewhat final point, like return idea
place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
increases insula, again, insula, brain region, gray matter volume. Typically,
talk gray matter, talking so-called cell bodies,
location neurons genome housed kind
housekeeping stuff there. white matter volume tends axons,


wires ensheathed stuff appears white MRIs, indeed
white microscope, indeed white, actually lipid, myelin. So,
increased gray matter volume insula significant finding
suggests people yoga increased volume areas
brain associated interoceptive awareness able make
judgements pain one experiencing pain, not just lean away
pain, utilize leverage even overcome pain. So, many studies
yoga meditation there, much mechanistic detail one.
fact, beautiful figure, Figure 3 paper shows gray
matter volume particular brain region scales almost linear way
duration yoga practice somebody taking years. So, people
had, well, hey subjects 15 16 years yoga practice
much larger left insula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated
abilities. find interesting lot activities don't
create kind changes brain volume, especially within insula. So, appears
not just performance yogic movements, overcoming kind
pushing end ranges motion push discomfort extent,
course, want people healthy, safe way, allows yoga
practitioners build structure function brain areas allow
cope pain better individuals, cope kinds interoceptive
challenges, will, not just pain cold, not just pain discomfort
particular position that. again, wouldn't want people placing
compromised position literally harm them, especially given earlier
heard Microstretching kind non-painful sort low-intensity sort actually
going effective increasing end range motion. study really
emphasizes extent practitioners yoga don't just learn movements,
learn control nervous system ways really reshapes relationship
pain, flexibility, kinds things neuromuscular system
designed do. final point, beautiful graph paper, beautiful
think explores subjective dimensions yoga insula
function, read nerdy form explain
means, "This frequency histogram categories mental strategies used yogis
versus controls cold pain tolerance task." describing
showing quantitatively people conceptualizing cold pain order get


it. different categories are, instance, distraction, right? people
just choose distract pain attempt to, people will try
ignore it, lot like distraction, nonetheless, engage negative emotion, sort
like, "[growls] like going dig, going resistance this." Control
subjects tended use approaches, whereas practitioners yoga tended use
sorts subjective approaches like positive imagery extent, ability
relax despite extreme cold, ability quote-unquote accept like, "This just
happening," despite extreme cold, observe, third person themselves.
greatest effect, course, breathe, focus respiration way deal
challenge, cold challenge. Now, subjective data, want
remind practitioners yoga not just using entirely different mental
strategies, far effective dealing pain, pain tolerance
much higher evidenced data previous graphs paper. So,
podcast episode certainly not yoga per se, flexibility
stretching, flexibility stretching elements within yogic practices. And,
course, yogic practices involve breathing mental work, lot things
balance, et cetera. vast landscape many know. think ever
manuscript pointed utility something like yoga sake
tapping particular set brain circuits mechanisms wick
multiple dimensions life, day-to-day life, stress, challenges dealing sorts
external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, et cetera,
excuse me, well increasing range motion increasing flexibility. So, ever
practice one embark not increase flexibility
limb range motion, also allow one cultivate improved mental
functioning relates pain tolerance features stress management
no doubt wick areas life, appears yoga quite useful practice.
so, interested increasing limb range motion
already practitioner yoga, great. can imagine someday there'll another
study like one 10 15-16 year practitioner graph.
dot way far end graph shows insula much bigger
rest ours, therefore internal awareness, pain thresholds,
stress management will much better,

02:00:36 Tools: Summary Stretching Protocols

place, real estate within brain call insular cortex, insula.
recall, way back beginning episode, talking von
Economo neurons, Constantin von Economo Austrian scientist discovered.
fact able make perform interpretations internal landscape
pain, dedication practice, instance, whether not pain
practice intentionally want improve ourselves, whether
not pain arriving externally imposed demands situations. Well,
insula handling that. fortunately, wonderful paper
published, years ago now journal Cerebral Cortex, fine
journal. year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance
Yoga Practitioners. tell like study. personally not practitioner
yoga, taken yoga classes years, done hot yoga
classes. rooms can get really, really warm, confess, done kind
standard yoga every now again. not something kept regularly.
study explored effects brain structure volume yoga practitioners.
aficionados yoga, pulled subjects
backgrounds the... Here, probably going mispronounce different things,
forgive me, Vinysasa yogas, Ashtanga yogas, Iyengar yogas,
Sivananda yogas. Okay, people new practices,
experienced. important take aways took yoga practitioners
didn't explore brain structure context yoga itself, looked
things like pain tolerance. So, used thermal stimulation, basically put people
conditions gave hot cold stimuli compared
yoga practitioners varying levels yoga experience no experience
yoga, so-called controls. found really interesting things,
lot data paper, something like highlight. pain tolerance
yoga practitioners double non-yoga practitioners, even
weren't so-called hot yoga. Right, also found pain tolerance
significantly greater, heat pain cold pain. also found significant
