answer commonly asked question alcohol consumption brain,
question often comes whether not low moderate amounts alcohol,
maybe one drink day one two drinks day kind thing, whether not
bad brain, particular, whether not causes degeneration neurons
nerve cells. Now, reason question comes often because, many
years, known high levels alcohol consumption, 12 24 drinks per
week more, certainly causing neurodegeneration, particular so-called
neocortex, outer layers brain house associative memories, house
ability think plan, house ability regulate primitive drives
according context, et cetera. make clear, drinking lot, having,
know, three four drinks per night every night week, clearly bad brain.
recent study, however, finally addressed question whether not low moderate
amounts alcohol consumption can cause brain degeneration. title study

happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,
volume people's voices will increase, people simply not
paying attention voice modulation, people start speaking
loudly, people speaking loudly. experience, right,
going party step outside moment go, "Oh, goodness,

shouting night just heard prefrontal cortex
shuts down, people stop modulating level speech quite much. also notice
people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start
dancing. areas prefrontal cortex normally providing
called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA
onto various parts brain involved impulsive motor behavior thought
patterns, shut prefrontal cortex, GABAergic suppression
impulses starts released, people will say things want say without
much forethought saying, might things want
without really thinking quite much might not even remember thinking


all, experience, say, thinking all. haven't talked
blacking yet effects alcohol memory, long there,
just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks
involved memory formation storage. oftentimes forget
events night drinking. One important things know
effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different
options, like B, say say that,
say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits
just one two nights regular drinking. Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily
mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not
drinking. want know actual substrate that, cellular substrate,
can briefly describe it. really interesting. Again, don't need know biology

aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans

months ideally longer,

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty

distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting

circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs

Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,

else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create

matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode
that. can find it, again, hubermanlab.com. direct links

deliberate cold exposure protocols can find hubermanlab.com, go
Neural Network newsletter. interested ice baths cold

description use deliberate cold exposure sake treating hangover.
here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not
large robust literature, evidence pointing fact
levels epinephrine, adrenaline, raised brain bloodstream,
components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain

understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold

dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate

explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body

using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people

particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal

realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,

ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome

thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't

really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

Irish. see lot claims online Irish first distill alcohol, but,
fact, not. Chinese first distill alcohol, took

organs body. take look epidemiology, is,
many people consuming alcohol much drinking. will
able, think, get good sense alcohol drinking,
drinking all, impacting brain body choices might want
make drink alcohol, even want eliminate alcohol
altogether. Okay, basic chemistry biology alcohol, and, again, make
clear even don't chemistry biology background.
structure alcohol, called water-soluble fat-soluble. Translated
meaningful you, means drink alcohol, can pass

cells. unlike lot substances drugs actually attach surface cells,
receptors, called, little parking spots, trigger bunch
downstreams, like, domino cascades effects, alcohol actually direct

explains damaging effects. mention three main types
alcohol. isopropyl, methyl, ethyl alcohol, last one, ethyl alcohol
ethanol, fit human consumption. However, still toxic, okay? produces
substantial stress damage cells. love able tell otherwise,
just fact. Ethanol produces substantial damage cells,
ingest ethanol, converted something else toxic
body. molecule inside us called NAD, may heard


NAD quite popular, lot discussion NAD longevity

ongoing terms research. nonetheless, ingest ethanol, NAD
related biochemical pathways involved converting ethanol something
called acetaldehyde, broken acetaldehyde. thought ethanol
bad, acetaldehyde particularly bad. Acetaldehyde poison. will kill cells. damages
kills cells indiscriminate cells damages kills. Now,
problem, obviously, body deals problem using another component
NAD biochemical pathway convert acetaldehyde something called acetate.
Acetate actually something body can use fuel. process going
ethanol acetaldehyde acetate involve production toxic molecule,
right? Again, acetaldehyde really toxic. NAD, want get technical,

acetaldehyde itself, leads effect inebriated drunk. think
people don't realize that, drunk actually poison-induced disruption
way neural circuits work. ask ourselves, like, neural
circuits, brain areas, body areas involved feeling drunk inebriated?
Now, thinking state tipsy happy really drunk little bit
drunk, want mention something think people aren't aware of,
fact people regular drinkers genetic predisposition
alcoholism, drink, tend feel energized good longer
periods time. Again, people genetic predisposition alcohol people
chronic drinkers even just, recall, chronic doesn't mean ton
alcohol drinking one two per night every night type drinkers
Thursday Sunday drinkers, people typically experience increase
alertness mood drink, whereas occasional drinkers will briefer,
meaning less long-lasting, period feeling good drink quickly
transition state tired start losing motor skills, start
slurring speech. also want emphasize distinct tolerance. talk
tolerance later exactly tolerance means. really want highlight
fact people ingest poison, 'cause indeed poison, range effects
different, can reliably predict people predisposition

every time drink, tend get real lift, become kind life party
lasts long while, people ones really careful
predisposition alcoholism. people also need careful
drinking amount drinking doing, even not full-blown
alcoholics. Now, course, people ingesting alcohol not accustomed
drink alcohol concerned drinking alcohol reasons,
can impair motor function judgment, et cetera. thinking biochemical
effects alcohol body, cases
consumed gut, right? Goes stomach, liver immediately starts
conversion talked ethanol acetaldehyde acetate,


amount acetaldehyde acetate making brain, crosses blood-
brain barrier. Again, brain fence around call blood-brain barrier
BBB. Many things, things, thankfully, can't pass across blood-brain
barrier, alcohol, water- fat-soluble, just cruises right across
fence milieu, environment brain, made couple
different major cell types, neurons, nerve cells, so-called glial cells,
nerve cells, talk effects soon.
happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,
volume people's voices will increase, people simply not
paying attention voice modulation, people start speaking
loudly, people speaking loudly. experience, right,
going party step outside moment go, "Oh, goodness,
shouting." come home, next day, got sore throat. might
picked sort bug, virus something, oftentimes just fact
shouting night just heard prefrontal cortex
shuts down, people stop modulating level speech quite much. also notice
people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start
dancing. areas prefrontal cortex normally providing
called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA
onto various parts brain involved impulsive motor behavior thought
patterns, shut prefrontal cortex, GABAergic suppression
impulses starts released, people will say things want say without
much forethought saying, might things want
without really thinking quite much might not even remember thinking


all, experience, say, thinking all. haven't talked
blacking yet effects alcohol memory, long there,
just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks
involved memory formation storage. oftentimes forget
events night drinking. One important things know
effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different
options, like B, say say that,
say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits
just one two nights regular drinking. Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily
mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not
drinking. want know actual substrate that, cellular substrate,
can briefly describe it. really interesting. Again, don't need know biology
understand this. increases number synapses, actual points
connection neural circuits control habitual behavior. literally
growth neural circuits brain lead existing habit execution, right,
performance things already know do, reduction neural
circuits, say reduction number synapses, contacts, within
neural circuits controlling behavior. this, again, not often discussed
aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans
undertake period abstinence anywhere two six months, neural
circuits return normal except cases people chronically drinking
large volumes alcohol many, many years. cases,
recovery brain circuitry people get sober, meaning completely sober, stop
drinking entirely, evidence long-lasting impact heavy alcohol usage
throughout lifespan. But, course, doesn't mean anyone suffering
alcoholism used not continue focus health.
absolutely should. not lost. people drinking lot years,
maybe went college drank lot years neural circuits
changed, period don't drink alcohol, again, two six
months ideally longer,

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty
stomach, within five 10 minutes, alcohol going within bloodstream
distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting
drunk quick,

00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk Alcoholism, Blackouts

even small amount alcohol, food gut can certainly
beneficial. Now, food alcohol absorption alcohol, go back
talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior
circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs
potentially valuable treatment. Getting back effects alcohol
serotonin, clear, beyond doubt, many circuits brain

sips alcohol, least people do. ingest alcohol


alcohol wears off, serotonin levels activity circuits really starts
drop, people feel less good. typically do, go
get another drink attempt kind restore feeling well-being mood.
Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even
fifth drink, absolute zero chance recovering energized mood,
right? people, drink more, will now start feel
suppressed. forebrain now shutting quite lot, lot motor cortical

also important understand relates phenomenon blackout. Many
people think blacking passing out, blackout drunk people drink

going differences created quickly people drinking, whether not

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

drinking for. Certainly people alcohol use disorder
alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going

can work people. fact, heavy drinkers people serious
alcohol use disorder, going cold turkey, is, stopping drinking completely, can
actually medically dangerous. path sobriety certain people looks
different path sobriety people. referring people
ingesting, again, somewhere between, average,

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol

extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not

however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

Irish. see lot claims online Irish first distill alcohol, but,
fact, not. Chinese first distill alcohol, took
place China first century. Alcohol used nutritional purposes,

organs body. take look epidemiology, is,
many people consuming alcohol much drinking. will
able, think, get good sense alcohol drinking,
drinking all, impacting brain body choices might want
make drink alcohol, even want eliminate alcohol
altogether. Okay, basic chemistry biology alcohol, and, again, make
clear even don't chemistry biology background.
structure alcohol, called water-soluble fat-soluble. Translated
meaningful you, means drink alcohol, can pass

explains damaging effects. mention three main types
alcohol. isopropyl, methyl, ethyl alcohol, last one, ethyl alcohol
ethanol, fit human consumption. However, still toxic, okay? produces
substantial stress damage cells. love able tell otherwise,
just fact. Ethanol produces substantial damage cells,
ingest ethanol, converted something else toxic
body. molecule inside us called NAD, may heard


NAD quite popular, lot discussion NAD longevity

NAD tend go across lifespan. ideas increasing levels NAD
may extend lifespan. lot still controversial, or, least say,
ongoing terms research. nonetheless, ingest ethanol, NAD
related biochemical pathways involved converting ethanol something
called acetaldehyde, broken acetaldehyde. thought ethanol
bad, acetaldehyde particularly bad. Acetaldehyde poison. will kill cells. damages
kills cells indiscriminate cells damages kills. Now,
problem, obviously, body deals problem using another component
NAD biochemical pathway convert acetaldehyde something called acetate.
Acetate actually something body can use fuel. process going
ethanol acetaldehyde acetate involve production toxic molecule,
right? Again, acetaldehyde really toxic. NAD, want get technical,

understand ingest alcohol, are, yes, ingesting poison,

percentage shuttled worse poison shuttled
fuel source. Now, important thing understand poison,
acetaldehyde itself, leads effect inebriated drunk. think
people don't realize that, drunk actually poison-induced disruption
way neural circuits work. ask ourselves, like, neural
circuits, brain areas, body areas involved feeling drunk inebriated?
Now, thinking state tipsy happy really drunk little bit
drunk, want mention something think people aren't aware of,
fact people regular drinkers genetic predisposition
alcoholism, drink, tend feel energized good longer
periods time. Again, people genetic predisposition alcohol people
chronic drinkers even just, recall, chronic doesn't mean ton
alcohol drinking one two per night every night type drinkers
Thursday Sunday drinkers, people typically experience increase
alertness mood drink, whereas occasional drinkers will briefer,
meaning less long-lasting, period feeling good drink quickly
transition state tired start losing motor skills, start
slurring speech. also want emphasize distinct tolerance. talk
tolerance later exactly tolerance means. really want highlight
fact people ingest poison, 'cause indeed poison, range effects
different, can reliably predict people predisposition

amount acetaldehyde acetate making brain, crosses blood-
brain barrier. Again, brain fence around call blood-brain barrier
BBB. Many things, things, thankfully, can't pass across blood-brain
barrier, alcohol, water- fat-soluble, just cruises right across
fence milieu, environment brain, made couple
different major cell types, neurons, nerve cells, so-called glial cells,
nerve cells, talk effects soon.
happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,
volume people's voices will increase, people simply not
paying attention voice modulation, people start speaking
loudly, people speaking loudly. experience, right,
going party step outside moment go, "Oh, goodness,
shouting." come home, next day, got sore throat. might
picked sort bug, virus something, oftentimes just fact
shouting night just heard prefrontal cortex
shuts down, people stop modulating level speech quite much. also notice
people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start
dancing. areas prefrontal cortex normally providing
called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA
onto various parts brain involved impulsive motor behavior thought
patterns, shut prefrontal cortex, GABAergic suppression
impulses starts released, people will say things want say without
much forethought saying, might things want
without really thinking quite much might not even remember thinking


all, experience, say, thinking all. haven't talked
blacking yet effects alcohol memory, long there,
just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks
involved memory formation storage. oftentimes forget
events night drinking. One important things know
effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different
options, like B, say say that,
say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits
just one two nights regular drinking. Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily
mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not
drinking. want know actual substrate that, cellular substrate,
can briefly describe it. really interesting. Again, don't need know biology
understand this. increases number synapses, actual points
connection neural circuits control habitual behavior. literally
growth neural circuits brain lead existing habit execution, right,
performance things already know do, reduction neural
circuits, say reduction number synapses, contacts, within
neural circuits controlling behavior. this, again, not often discussed
aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans
undertake period abstinence anywhere two six months, neural
circuits return normal except cases people chronically drinking
large volumes alcohol many, many years. cases,
recovery brain circuitry people get sober, meaning completely sober, stop
drinking entirely, evidence long-lasting impact heavy alcohol usage
throughout lifespan. But, course, doesn't mean anyone suffering
alcoholism used not continue focus health.
absolutely should. not lost. people drinking lot years,
maybe went college drank lot years neural circuits
changed, period don't drink alcohol, again, two six
months ideally longer,

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty
stomach, within five 10 minutes, alcohol going within bloodstream
distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting
drunk quick,

00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk Alcoholism, Blackouts

even small amount alcohol, food gut can certainly
beneficial. Now, food alcohol absorption alcohol, go back
talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior
circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin

bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,

else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create

matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived

getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow

screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red

within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal

every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types

testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered

things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon

kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve

problem, obviously, body deals problem using another component
NAD biochemical pathway convert acetaldehyde something called acetate.
Acetate actually something body can use fuel. process going

Now, thinking state tipsy happy really drunk little bit

happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits

mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits

aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans
undertake period abstinence anywhere two six months, neural

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty

distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not

talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior

neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,

recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset

largely cleared system, well, old lore
combines modern science says, well, can spike adrenaline,
certainly getting ice bath getting cold shower kind cold
body water, provided can safely, will sharply increase adrenaline
and, say, dopamine. shown talked
podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally
done immersion neck, again, safely, please, please, please, cold
shower getting shower much possible. cold? Well,
going vary person person. suggest making cold uncomfortable
really want get know can stay safely without,
instance, giving heart attack, water really, really cold,
course can give heart attack. showers won't go cold, although
probably will. Again, please use caution.

01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes

Spike adrenaline, spike dopamine deliberate cold exposure safely.

here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover

Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water

drink one glass water. say better two glasses water given
dehydrating effects alcohol, even better water electrolytes.
certainly set better day next day. don't manage
that, 'cause suppose kind geeky walking around electrolyte packets
bar whatnot, although, know, geeky, book, good thing, next day,
take electrolytes upon waking, maybe even go
sleep night drinking. hangover's made worse disturbed sleep, made worse
disrupted gut microbiome, made worse disrupted electrolytes, made worse
depletion epinephrine dopamine. replenishing microbiome
fermented foods, low-sugar fermented foods, is, using safe deliberate
cold exposure spiking adrenaline increasing dopamine,
consuming electrolytes going beneficial. folks examine.com,
website really like just much useful information, assembled
list things proposed, purported improve, or, say,
remove effects hangover, and, point like point
there, isn't lot quality science support idea one compound can
eliminate hangover. probably hangover, again, arises multiple
organs tissues systems brain body. Nonetheless,
terrific list things, everything Japanese pear fruit juice
proposed this, really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.
Frankly, look literature elsewhere, one simply cannot find
magic substance, one herb, one potion can wipe away hangover. Getting rid
hangover going best solved collection

01:20:45 Types Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners

small number powerful things, already listed off few. However,
additional things one can relieving hangover, one
thoughtful sorts alcohol one consumes. find


interesting. actually studies types alcohol lead
greatest hangovers. actually lot legend lore well.
people said, instance, drinks high sugar content lead greater
hangovers. Turns not case, least not science points to.
look expected hangover severity, find bottom end
scale, drink not going tell you, moment, find
near is, instance, beer. consumption beer, provided not
overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce
hangover. Again, within amounts comfortable person drink,
enough experience body weight tolerate without
getting very, drunk. point sugar causing hangover,
well, ethanol diluted orange juice probably top list

place. covered major effects alcohol lead state call
drunkenness inebriation. Again, range there. can tipsy, people can
blackout drunk, people can passed drunk. also talked hangover
fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic
tolerance, rapid tolerance, metabolic tolerance, psychological tolerance.
keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,
pretty recent, journal "Pharmacology Biochemistry Behavior." Incidentally,
not incidentally, first journal ever published particular

acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived

reduction dopamine serotonin related molecules circuits. basically
getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal

drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

just fact. Ethanol produces substantial damage cells,
ingest ethanol, converted something else toxic

problem, obviously, body deals problem using another component
NAD biochemical pathway convert acetaldehyde something called acetate.
Acetate actually something body can use fuel. process going
ethanol acetaldehyde acetate involve production toxic molecule,
right? Again, acetaldehyde really toxic. NAD, want get technical,

happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,

people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start

called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA

just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks

areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different

say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits

mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not

aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,

talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior
circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs
potentially valuable treatment. Getting back effects alcohol

Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

However, remiss didn't say reason myth came be, that,
say, truth came be, indeed ingesting alcohol will alleviate
hangover worse hangover will show up, reason came
ingestion alcohol will cause constricted vessels giving

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not

People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going

absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body

using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people

toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon

kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

Now, thinking state tipsy happy really drunk little bit

different major cell types, neurons, nerve cells, so-called glial cells,

happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,

people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start

just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks

effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different

say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits

mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something

probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated

release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs
potentially valuable treatment. Getting back effects alcohol

Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols

ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.

mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-

proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize

not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially

bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol

extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast

responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,

acetaldehyde itself, leads effect inebriated drunk. think
people don't realize that, drunk actually poison-induced disruption
way neural circuits work. ask ourselves, like, neural
circuits, brain areas, body areas involved feeling drunk inebriated?
Now, thinking state tipsy happy really drunk little bit
drunk, want mention something think people aren't aware of,
fact people regular drinkers genetic predisposition
alcoholism, drink, tend feel energized good longer
periods time. Again, people genetic predisposition alcohol people
chronic drinkers even just, recall, chronic doesn't mean ton
alcohol drinking one two per night every night type drinkers
Thursday Sunday drinkers, people typically experience increase
alertness mood drink, whereas occasional drinkers will briefer,
meaning less long-lasting, period feeling good drink quickly
transition state tired start losing motor skills, start
slurring speech. also want emphasize distinct tolerance. talk
tolerance later exactly tolerance means. really want highlight
fact people ingest poison, 'cause indeed poison, range effects
different, can reliably predict people predisposition
alcoholism people regular drinkers contour
timing different effects. And, again, people tend feel alert excited
every time drink, tend get real lift, become kind life party
lasts long while, people ones really careful
predisposition alcoholism. people also need careful
drinking amount drinking doing, even not full-blown
alcoholics. Now, course, people ingesting alcohol not accustomed
drink alcohol concerned drinking alcohol reasons,
can impair motor function judgment, et cetera. thinking biochemical
effects alcohol body, cases
consumed gut, right? Goes stomach, liver immediately starts
conversion talked ethanol acetaldehyde acetate,


amount acetaldehyde acetate making brain, crosses blood-
brain barrier. Again, brain fence around call blood-brain barrier
BBB. Many things, things, thankfully, can't pass across blood-brain
barrier, alcohol, water- fat-soluble, just cruises right across
fence milieu, environment brain, made couple
different major cell types, neurons, nerve cells, so-called glial cells,
nerve cells, talk effects soon.
happens alcohol gets brain makes us feel tipsy drunk and,
people, makes people feel really especially energized happy? Well, alcohol
indiscriminate terms brain areas goes to. Again, doesn't bind particular
receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,
volume people's voices will increase, people simply not
paying attention voice modulation, people start speaking
loudly, people speaking loudly. experience, right,
going party step outside moment go, "Oh, goodness,
shouting." come home, next day, got sore throat. might
picked sort bug, virus something, oftentimes just fact
shouting night just heard prefrontal cortex
shuts down, people stop modulating level speech quite much. also notice
people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start
dancing. areas prefrontal cortex normally providing
called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA
onto various parts brain involved impulsive motor behavior thought
patterns, shut prefrontal cortex, GABAergic suppression
impulses starts released, people will say things want say without
much forethought saying, might things want
without really thinking quite much might not even remember thinking


all, experience, say, thinking all. haven't talked
blacking yet effects alcohol memory, long there,
just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks
involved memory formation storage. oftentimes forget
events night drinking. One important things know
effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different
options, like B, say say that,
say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits
just one two nights regular drinking. Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily
mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not
drinking. want know actual substrate that, cellular substrate,
can briefly describe it. really interesting. Again, don't need know biology
understand this. increases number synapses, actual points
connection neural circuits control habitual behavior. literally
growth neural circuits brain lead existing habit execution, right,
performance things already know do, reduction neural
circuits, say reduction number synapses, contacts, within

aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans
undertake period abstinence anywhere two six months, neural

large volumes alcohol many, many years. cases,

alcoholism used not continue focus health.
absolutely should. not lost. people drinking lot years,
maybe went college drank lot years neural circuits
changed, period don't drink alcohol, again, two six
months ideally longer,

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty
stomach, within five 10 minutes, alcohol going within bloodstream
distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting
drunk quick,

00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk Alcoholism, Blackouts

talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior
circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs
potentially valuable treatment. Getting back effects alcohol

alcohol wears off, serotonin levels activity circuits really starts
drop, people feel less good. typically do, go
get another drink attempt kind restore feeling well-being mood.
Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even
fifth drink, absolute zero chance recovering energized mood,
right? people, drink more, will now start feel

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help

People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,

toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams

emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon

doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

receptors, seem propensity affinity particular brain areas
involved certain kinds thinking behavior. one first things
happens slight, least first drink second drink,
slight suppression activity neurons prefrontal cortex. area
neocortex involved thinking planning and, perhaps all,
suppression impulsive behavior. go party serving alcohol
people consuming drinks, notice minutes party,
volume people's voices will increase, people simply not
paying attention voice modulation, people start speaking
loudly, people speaking loudly. experience, right,
going party step outside moment go, "Oh, goodness,
shouting." come home, next day, got sore throat. might
picked sort bug, virus something, oftentimes just fact
shouting night just heard prefrontal cortex
shuts down, people stop modulating level speech quite much. also notice
people start gesticulating more, people will start standing sitting more,
start walking around more, music on, people might spontaneously start
dancing. areas prefrontal cortex normally providing
called top-down inhibition. releasing neurotransmitter called GABA
onto various parts brain involved impulsive motor behavior thought
patterns, shut prefrontal cortex, GABAergic suppression
impulses starts released, people will say things want say without
much forethought saying, might things want
without really thinking quite much might not even remember thinking


all, experience, say, thinking all. haven't talked
blacking yet effects alcohol memory, long there,
just tell alcohol strong effect suppressing neural networks
involved memory formation storage. oftentimes forget
events night drinking. One important things know
effects alcohol brain disruption top-down inhibition, but, also,
areas brain involved flexible behavior, sort considering different
options, like B, say say that,
say way say way, might little tactful,

00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility

brain areas basically shut entirely people just tend say
want say. key thing understand people drink, prefrontal
cortex top-down inhibition diminished, is, habitual behavior impulsive
behavior starts increase. Now, interesting true short term,
people one two, maybe three four drinks, also true
often people drink, changes circuits underlie habitual
impulsive behavior. really important highlight, much want drill
bit deeply. person drinks, say, every Thursday night every
Friday night goes Saturdays every Saturday, evidence
changes neural circuits brain control habitual behavior
impulsive behavior, modified strengthened ways make
people habitual impulsive outside times drinking,
drink, impulsive habitual behavior tends increase even further.
something not often talked discussing effects alcohol.
mean, know effects drunk can bad, right? Can bad terms
judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk terrible thing, get
people killed on. rarely hear changes neural circuits
just one two nights regular drinking. Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily
mean every day every night. person simply drinks every
Thursday every Friday just week three four drinks maybe even
more. person going experience decrease top-down inhibition,
increase impulsivity habitual behavior, brake behaviors


removed drinking, also changes neural circuits
allow habitual impulsive behavior occur readily even not
drinking. want know actual substrate that, cellular substrate,
can briefly describe it. really interesting. Again, don't need know biology
understand this. increases number synapses, actual points
connection neural circuits control habitual behavior. literally
growth neural circuits brain lead existing habit execution, right,
performance things already know do, reduction neural
circuits, say reduction number synapses, contacts, within
neural circuits controlling behavior. this, again, not often discussed
aspect alcohol intake. Fortunately, reversible. animals humans
undertake period abstinence anywhere two six months, neural
circuits return normal except cases people chronically drinking
large volumes alcohol many, many years. cases,
recovery brain circuitry people get sober, meaning completely sober, stop
drinking entirely, evidence long-lasting impact heavy alcohol usage
throughout lifespan. But, course, doesn't mean anyone suffering
alcoholism used not continue focus health.
absolutely should. not lost. people drinking lot years,
maybe went college drank lot years neural circuits
changed, period don't drink alcohol, again, two six
months ideally longer,

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty
stomach, within five 10 minutes, alcohol going within bloodstream
distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting
drunk quick,

00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk Alcoholism, Blackouts

even small amount alcohol, food gut can certainly

talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior
circuitry. also dramatic changes activity neurons control
release so-called serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator. changes activity
neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs
potentially valuable treatment. Getting back effects alcohol

Now, typically happens people ingest third fourth, maybe even

right? people, drink more, will now start feel

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset

People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,

fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy

current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon

kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty

distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting

talking biochemical neurochemical effects alcohol brain.
talked top-down inhibition, talked habitual impulsive behavior

neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk
doctor. Again, great utility SSRIs, and, also, conditions like
OCD, shown beneficial, really don't want throw SSRIs

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,

else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce

fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic

going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion

point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might

doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part

going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption

neural circuits can remodified back original state. consider
neurochemical effects alcohol brain body. And, again,
right now, confining conversation people drinking, average, one
two drinks per night. Now, people might think two drinks per night lot,
lot will depend body weight. instance, people weigh 110
pounds, ingest two alcoholic drinks going substantially different
terms biochemical effects somebody weighs 220 pounds. course
tolerance will also factor this, genetic background will also factor this,
indeed whether not people eaten will factor this, lot factors


talk that. time being, curious food impacts
effects alcohol feelings drunk, may heard, instance,
somebody's inebriated want sober up, eat something.
Turns not work. work, however. eat something
prior drinking alcohol ingesting alcohol, will slow absorption alcohol
bloodstream. words, won't feel drunk fast, many you,
probably comes no surprise, particular, meal includes carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, okay?. inclusion three major macronutrients seems slow
absorption alcohol bloodstream far one
two macronutrients present. Now, already inebriated
glass wine beer eat something, chances alcohol already
made bloodstream moves bloodstream quickly. Again,
fat-soluble water-soluble, within minutes, right? empty
stomach, within five 10 minutes, alcohol going within bloodstream
distributed throughout body, maybe even faster depending type
alcohol metabolism. already drunk eat something, not
going sober quickly, certainly will blunt effects additional
alcohol might consume. somebody concerned getting
drunk quick,

00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk Alcoholism, Blackouts

neural circuits many neural circuits, particular, involved mood
feelings well-being. Recently, lot interest serotonin
study released showed pretty conclusively serotonin levels can't really
explain depression depression-like symptoms. want make clear
although study show serotonin levels not necessarily associated
depression, study interpreted many mean SSRIs, selective serotonin


reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase
serotonin serotonin isn't involved depression. logic doesn't really hold
together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder

current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even

debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people

alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not

however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear

later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset

However, remiss didn't say reason myth came be, that,
say, truth came be, indeed ingesting alcohol will alleviate

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode
that. can find it, again, hubermanlab.com. direct links

deliberate cold exposure protocols can find hubermanlab.com, go
Neural Network newsletter. interested ice baths cold
showers ways leverage those, can find there. won't find
description use deliberate cold exposure sake treating hangover.
here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not
large robust literature, evidence pointing fact
levels epinephrine, adrenaline, raised brain bloodstream,
components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain
bloodstream, want clear want emphasize safety. way
understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold

alcohol, get ice bath cold shower body temperature initially
dips rebounds increases. process going occur
people not alcohol system. alcohol system, one

get cold lake get even cold shower ice bath,
possibility going very, far ladder hypothermic territory
can dangerous. Now, terms dealing hangover alcohol
largely cleared system, well, old lore
combines modern science says, well, can spike adrenaline,
certainly getting ice bath getting cold shower kind cold
body water, provided can safely, will sharply increase adrenaline
and, say, dopamine. shown talked
podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting

grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,

substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,

reuptake inhibitors, net effect increasing serotonins, things
like Prozac, et cetera, drugs somehow not helpful increase

together going use opportunity just clarify really occurred
there, talk serotonin relates alcohol consumption things
like feeling good depression. key thing this, SSRIs can help alleviate
depression. right. SSRIs can help alleviate depression. often, not
always, associated side effects, dosage important, et cetera.
probably support relief depression changing neural circuits, not necessarily
increasing serotonin itself. is, increasing serotonin drugs likely changed
neural circuits involved mood, allowing people feel better so-called

bit confusion, and, again, using episode alcohol highlight
confusion think timely, study just came
lot chatter people depressed, not necessarily
serotonin levels low. However, serotonin levels increased things
like Prozac, Zoloft, SSRIs, oftentimes is, yes, relief depression,
probably not restoring serotonin levels, per se. probably
serotonin facilitates changes neural circuits need occur order
people feel elevated mood, okay? So, again, bit tangent aside,
think vital one people know about. Again, thinking taking
SSRIs currently taking heard news, definitely talk

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not
effect, maybe change hormones, et cetera, predisposes
young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut

not either/or no single gene alcoholism. Well, promise will
also talk documented positive effects alcohol. Although
far between, exist. that, remiss didn't
emphasize terrible things alcohol way it.
enjoy alcohol, again, like say feel guilty telling
know much people enjoy good drink every while,
say good drink people like taste alcohol. suppose
lucked don't really like taste alcohol just puts sleep,
know people enjoy it. want point zero evidence
that, know, provided somebody drinking age, certainly not stage brain

three four weeks month, not going cause major health concerns
major health issues people. suppose zero little alcohol

person going drinking all. So, again, enjoy alcoholic drinks, not
trying take away means, know drinking
consuming kind typical chronic pattern, can now refer
it, one two night stacked Friday maybe three four
Saturday, kind pattern drinking, quite common. one
serious effects think impact so-called gut-brain
axis, sake today's discussion, gut-liver-brain axis. don't think gut-liver-
brain axis ever discussed podcast, maybe podcast. Although
moment say that, know, gut-liver-brain axis, people going come
with, suppose, gut, liver, brains. event, brain. gut.
gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain
communicate way nerve cells, neurons nerve connections, vagus nerve
particular, way chemical signaling. gut also communicates way


chemical signaling and, believe not, way neural signaling, too, liver.
And, talked earlier, liver first site alcohol broken
metabolized component parts. liver also communicating brain
chemical signaling neural signaling, gut-liver-brain axis.
find people ingest alcohol amount inducing disruption
so-called gut microbiome, trillions little microbacteria take resident
gut live inside time help support immune system
literally signal way electrical signals chemical signals brain
increase release things like serotonin dopamine regulate mood
generally positive ways. Well, alcohol really disrupts bacteria,
come no surprise. mean, earlier, talked well known, want
to, know, sterilize something, want kill bacteria, pour alcohol it.

"Oh, boy, comes." no peroxide around got wound

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much

talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.

mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-

lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune

proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try

sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15

even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical

substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not

young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people

two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce

going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,

screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part

going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not
effect, maybe change hormones, et cetera, predisposes
young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help

components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain

something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going

absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body

week, also light moderate alcohol consumption type, wine, beer, spirits, et
cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent

best amount alcohol drink zero glasses per week ounces per week.
drinking low amounts alcohol, make sure things
promote health. drinking moderate certainly
heavy drinkers, please everything can move away
quit entirely. even moderate consumers alcohol, going
want aware negative health effects things offset

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like

every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types

drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least

point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification

talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not
effect, maybe change hormones, et cetera, predisposes
young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut

not either/or no single gene alcoholism. Well, promise will
also talk documented positive effects alcohol. Although
far between, exist. that, remiss didn't
emphasize terrible things alcohol way it.
enjoy alcohol, again, like say feel guilty telling
know much people enjoy good drink every while,
say good drink people like taste alcohol. suppose
lucked don't really like taste alcohol just puts sleep,
know people enjoy it. want point zero evidence
that, know, provided somebody drinking age, certainly not stage brain
development, one drink two drinks every now again, meaning every
three four weeks month, not going cause major health concerns
major health issues people. suppose zero little alcohol

person going drinking all. So, again, enjoy alcoholic drinks, not
trying take away means, know drinking
consuming kind typical chronic pattern, can now refer
it, one two night stacked Friday maybe three four
Saturday, kind pattern drinking, quite common. one
serious effects think impact so-called gut-brain
axis, sake today's discussion, gut-liver-brain axis. don't think gut-liver-
brain axis ever discussed podcast, maybe podcast. Although
moment say that, know, gut-liver-brain axis, people going come
with, suppose, gut, liver, brains. event, brain. gut.
gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain
communicate way nerve cells, neurons nerve connections, vagus nerve
particular, way chemical signaling. gut also communicates way


chemical signaling and, believe not, way neural signaling, too, liver.
And, talked earlier, liver first site alcohol broken
metabolized component parts. liver also communicating brain
chemical signaling neural signaling, gut-liver-brain axis.
find people ingest alcohol amount inducing disruption
so-called gut microbiome, trillions little microbacteria take resident
gut live inside time help support immune system
literally signal way electrical signals chemical signals brain
increase release things like serotonin dopamine regulate mood
generally positive ways. Well, alcohol really disrupts bacteria,
come no surprise. mean, earlier, talked well known, want
to, know, sterilize something, want kill bacteria, pour alcohol it.

"Oh, boy, comes." no peroxide around got wound

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing

much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols

talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.

mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-

lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune

primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,

pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,

substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not
effect, maybe change hormones, et cetera, predisposes
young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

emphasize terrible things alcohol way it.
enjoy alcohol, again, like say feel guilty telling
know much people enjoy good drink every while,
say good drink people like taste alcohol. suppose
lucked don't really like taste alcohol just puts sleep,
know people enjoy it. want point zero evidence
that, know, provided somebody drinking age, certainly not stage brain
development, one drink two drinks every now again, meaning every

major health issues people. suppose zero little alcohol

person going drinking all. So, again, enjoy alcoholic drinks, not
trying take away means, know drinking

gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help

People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,

screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order

resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Young

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Now,
talking little bit genetic predisposition, couple important
points like make that. First all, sorts genes involved setting
someone path alcoholism not? Well, come no surprise
genes chronic alcohol usage modifies, tend fall primarily pathways
related genetic control serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember top-
inhibition involvement GABA, and, no surprise, HPA,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. those, course combined environment,


combine patterns abuse, right, know social setting
lot people drinking, likelihood going drink much
higher, social pressures, trauma, right? people will use alcohol self-medicate
try turn off thinking deal trauma, et cetera. combine
environment, genes serotonin synthesis receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA HPA axis, combine environmental pressures give rise
alcohol use disorders. fairly coherent picture here, right?
not case where, instance, people lot enzyme metabolizing
alcohol, talk minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, not like
necessarily people become alcoholics, whereas certainly certain cultures,
certain Asian cultures particular, gene differences lead low
levels alcohol dehydrogenase. actually people little alcohol
dehydrogenase ingest alcohol, get red just feel sick.
somebody sip alcohol just feel horrible, makes
feel nauseous, chances gene variants create situation
not making much alcohol dehydrogenase. just simply can't metabolize alcohol
just get rapid buildup toxic effects alcohol, acetaldehyde, not
converting empty calories. cultures lot genetic
variants genes expressed people lot alcohol
dehydrogenase, sure, can drink more, converting alcohol
toxic form non-toxic form, and, yes, course, will observe
alcoholism communities drinking more, want
emphasize environmental factors playing strong role there, too,
can drink more, likely drink more. somebody feels sick
immediately drinking, likely not going engage alcohol
consumption, especially things genetically related, and, course, genes
culture location world tend run together. gene
alcoholism? Well, isn't one single gene. Chances immediate
relative chronic abuser alcohol several relatives chronic abusers
alcohol, well, going predispose alcoholic. since don't know
genes express unless genetic testing, things available
people aren't that, assay, will, not assay, say,
assay test run lab determine something, not one
recommend go drink order do, noticed somebody


else somebody can drink lot throughout night increased energy
can just drink drink drink, especially blackout episodes, not
remembering things next day despite alert throughout entire night
on, well, concerned might actually genetic variant
predisposing alcoholism. thing predisposes people abuse
alcohol age. People start drinking younger ages greatly predisposed
developing alcohol dependence regardless family history alcoholism. Okay,
going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack
oversight, going higher tendency, higher probability,
say, will start drinking younger age. However, even people grow
nowhere near relatives, start drinking young age, instance, 13
younger 14 15, much higher probability going develop
long-lasting dependence alcohol. People take first sip alcohol later, 15,
16, one hope even later, can say one hope 'cause now that,
know, age generation where, know, think things young
people do, go, "Oh, gosh, wait abstain."
know? just happens. don't know, neural circuit
can't explain yet. people who, instance, drink reach legal age
drinking, US, believe every state 21 years old, take first
drink 21, probability go develop full-blown alcohol dependence
alcohol use disorder, called, AUD, low. Now, subset will
strong genetic predisposition maybe life circumstances create
pattern become chronic drinker. found interesting. Genes
matter, also age somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether
not changes neural circuitry consequence
drinking make people want seek alcohol, whether not
effect, maybe change hormones, et cetera, predisposes
young drinkers become chronic drinkers even full-blown alcoholics, certainly
developing alcohol use disorder. definition that. can talk it.
involves amount drinking certain period time, et cetera. clear
drinking early life creates propensity development alcohol use disorder


later life. genetic component developing alcohol use disorder,
find interesting people gene variants delay onset
drinking, well, probability develop full-blown alcohol use disorder
drops well. again, genes environments.

00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut

not either/or no single gene alcoholism. Well, promise will
also talk documented positive effects alcohol. Although
far between, exist. that, remiss didn't
emphasize terrible things alcohol way it.
enjoy alcohol, again, like say feel guilty telling
know much people enjoy good drink every while,
say good drink people like taste alcohol. suppose
lucked don't really like taste alcohol just puts sleep,
know people enjoy it. want point zero evidence
that, know, provided somebody drinking age, certainly not stage brain
development, one drink two drinks every now again, meaning every
three four weeks month, not going cause major health concerns
major health issues people. suppose zero little alcohol
dehydrogenase, might make feel sick, probably not kind
person going drinking all. So, again, enjoy alcoholic drinks, not
trying take away means, know drinking
consuming kind typical chronic pattern, can now refer
it, one two night stacked Friday maybe three four
Saturday, kind pattern drinking, quite common. one
serious effects think impact so-called gut-brain
axis, sake today's discussion, gut-liver-brain axis. don't think gut-liver-
brain axis ever discussed podcast, maybe podcast. Although
moment say that, know, gut-liver-brain axis, people going come
with, suppose, gut, liver, brains. event, brain. gut.
gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain
communicate way nerve cells, neurons nerve connections, vagus nerve
particular, way chemical signaling. gut also communicates way


chemical signaling and, believe not, way neural signaling, too, liver.
And, talked earlier, liver first site alcohol broken

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much

talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,

mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-

lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune

again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,

pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms

substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

going repeat that. People start drinking younger great risk
developing alcoholism even don't alcoholism family. Now, course,
don't epidemiologist understand grow family
drinkers alcohol everywhere, especially peer pressure lack

However, remiss didn't say reason myth came be, that,
say, truth came be, indeed ingesting alcohol will alleviate
hangover worse hangover will show up, reason came
ingestion alcohol will cause constricted vessels giving

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode
that. can find it, again, hubermanlab.com. direct links
tools related deliberate cold exposure entire newsletter
deliberate cold exposure protocols can find hubermanlab.com, go
Neural Network newsletter. interested ice baths cold
showers ways leverage those, can find there. won't find
description use deliberate cold exposure sake treating hangover.
here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not
large robust literature, evidence pointing fact
levels epinephrine, adrenaline, raised brain bloodstream,
components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain
bloodstream, want clear want emphasize safety. way
understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold
exposure previously, talked normally, people not ingesting
alcohol, get ice bath cold shower body temperature initially
dips rebounds increases. process going occur
people not alcohol system. alcohol system, one

alcohol disrupts central command centers brain control
temperature regulation, leads slightly hypothermic. go
get cold lake get even cold shower ice bath,
possibility going very, far ladder hypothermic territory
can dangerous. Now, terms dealing hangover alcohol
largely cleared system, well, old lore
combines modern science says, well, can spike adrenaline,
certainly getting ice bath getting cold shower kind cold
body water, provided can safely, will sharply increase adrenaline
and, say, dopamine. shown talked
podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally

news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great
clinical trial this. Well, may positive effects low level

anybody's anything. remiss, however, didn't tell resveratrol

things alcohol health. beginning episode, referenced study
showing indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption 12 24 drinks per
week, also light moderate alcohol consumption type, wine, beer, spirits, et
cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent
increase shrinkage gray matter volume white matter tracts,
axons, wires, were, connect different neurons function much
alcohol people drink. also seen recent study
referenced beginning show note captions. So, again, probably
best amount alcohol drink zero glasses per week ounces per week.
drinking low amounts alcohol, make sure things
promote health. drinking moderate certainly
heavy drinkers, please everything can move away
quit entirely. even moderate consumers alcohol, going
want aware negative health effects things offset

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve

gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain

podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally

01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes

Spike adrenaline, spike dopamine deliberate cold exposure safely.
components hangover good targets trying alleviate hangover, and,
here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover
multifaceted phenomenon. not like one molecule one receptor. bunch
things happening brain body. dehydration associated alcohol?
Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water
also sodium. Sodium electrolyte critical function neurons, making sure
enough sodium, potassium, magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
going important proper brain function, bodily organ function. Even people
just one two drinks night before, likely electrolyte
balance fluid balance going disrupted, alcohol also
disrupts so-called vasopressin pathway. talked lot vasopressin way


interacts controls different aspects water retention water release
body form urine episode salt. So, again, referring
hubermanlab.com site can find episode salt balance ways
restore electrolyte balance. electrolytes proper levels
drink ideal. people will say every glass alcohol drink,
drink one glass water. say better two glasses water given
dehydrating effects alcohol, even better water electrolytes.
certainly set better day next day. don't manage
that, 'cause suppose kind geeky walking around electrolyte packets
bar whatnot, although, know, geeky, book, good thing, next day,
take electrolytes upon waking, maybe even go
sleep night drinking. hangover's made worse disturbed sleep, made worse
disrupted gut microbiome, made worse disrupted electrolytes, made worse
depletion epinephrine dopamine. replenishing microbiome
fermented foods, low-sugar fermented foods, is, using safe deliberate
cold exposure spiking adrenaline increasing dopamine,
consuming electrolytes going beneficial. folks examine.com,
website really like just much useful information, assembled
list things proposed, purported improve, or, say,
remove effects hangover, and, point like point
there, isn't lot quality science support idea one compound can
eliminate hangover. probably hangover, again, arises multiple
organs tissues systems brain body. Nonetheless,
terrific list things, everything Japanese pear fruit juice
proposed this, really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.
Frankly, look literature elsewhere, one simply cannot find
magic substance, one herb, one potion can wipe away hangover. Getting rid
hangover going best solved collection

01:20:45 Types Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners

small number powerful things, already listed off few. However,
additional things one can relieving hangover, one
thoughtful sorts alcohol one consumes. find


interesting. actually studies types alcohol lead
greatest hangovers. actually lot legend lore well.
people said, instance, drinks high sugar content lead greater
hangovers. Turns not case, least not science points to.
look expected hangover severity, find bottom end
scale, drink not going tell you, moment, find
near is, instance, beer. consumption beer, provided not
overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce
hangover. Again, within amounts comfortable person drink,
enough experience body weight tolerate without
getting very, drunk. point sugar causing hangover,
well, ethanol diluted orange juice probably top list

imagine people getting probiotic prebiotic, regularly, just
drinking, low-sugar fermented foods, see effects terms
subjective effects hangover also physiological measures. think way
think hangover overall that, again, represents multifaceted, multi-organ,
multi-tissue phenomenon, best way deal multi-cell, multi-tissue,

01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance

ask best way avoid hangover, not drink first
place. covered major effects alcohol lead state call
drunkenness inebriation. Again, range there. can tipsy, people can
blackout drunk, people can passed drunk. also talked hangover
fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic
tolerance, rapid tolerance, metabolic tolerance, psychological tolerance.
keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,
pretty recent, journal "Pharmacology Biochemistry Behavior." Incidentally,
not incidentally, first journal ever published particular
affection journal. Nonetheless, called Tolerance alcohol: critical yet


understudied factor alcohol addiction. paper include alcohol
addiction title, not just alcohol addiction. basic summary
tolerance is. First all, tolerance refers reduced effects alcohol

old friend, meaning molecule comes
podcast episodes, dopamine. Whether not somebody predisposition
alcoholism not, whether not experienced drinker not, people initially
start drinking, increases dopamine, call dopaminergic
transmission. Dopamine involved motivation, craving, creates sense well-
being, increases energy, again, typically beginning alcohol exposure.
occurs people sharp spike, increase. Again, somebody not
alcohol dehydrogenase low levels enzyme convert
acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived
increase. soon after, actually triggered increase, long slow
reduction dopamine serotonin related molecules circuits. basically
getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow


reduction dopamine serotonin gets even longer. words, negative

robust. However, also reduction reinforcing properties alcohol.
shrinking feel good blip happens one first ingests alcohol,
measured animals humans. first drink somebody has,
provided enough alcohol dehydrogenase doesn't make feel
nauseous sick right away, feel really good. wears off, feel
kind lousy want drink might drink more.
subsequent drink, even drinks different nights even different weeks,

alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going

actually medically dangerous. path sobriety certain people looks
different path sobriety people. referring people
ingesting, again, somewhere between, average,

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great
clinical trial this. Well, may positive effects low level
consumption. not trying take away anybody's red wine. not trying take away
anybody's anything. remiss, however, didn't tell resveratrol
argument drinking, drinking red wine particular,

01:35:42 Alcohol & Brain Thickness

just not good one. just not supported peer-reviewed research.
things alcohol health. beginning episode, referenced study
showing indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption 12 24 drinks per
week, also light moderate alcohol consumption type, wine, beer, spirits, et
cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent
increase shrinkage gray matter volume white matter tracts,

best amount alcohol drink zero glasses per week ounces per week.
drinking low amounts alcohol, make sure things
promote health. drinking moderate certainly
heavy drinkers, please everything can move away
quit entirely. even moderate consumers alcohol, going
want aware negative health effects things offset

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

emphasize terrible things alcohol way it.
enjoy alcohol, again, like say feel guilty telling
know much people enjoy good drink every while,
say good drink people like taste alcohol. suppose
lucked don't really like taste alcohol just puts sleep,
know people enjoy it. want point zero evidence
that, know, provided somebody drinking age, certainly not stage brain

three four weeks month, not going cause major health concerns
major health issues people. suppose zero little alcohol

with, suppose, gut, liver, brains. event, brain. gut.
gut runs throat end intestine. gut brain
communicate way nerve cells, neurons nerve connections, vagus nerve
particular, way chemical signaling. gut also communicates way


chemical signaling and, believe not, way neural signaling, too, liver.
And, talked earlier, liver first site alcohol broken

generally positive ways. Well, alcohol really disrupts bacteria,
come no surprise. mean, earlier, talked well known, want
to, know, sterilize something, want kill bacteria, pour alcohol it.

kid, and, know, moment take peroxide, like,
"Oh, boy, comes." no peroxide around got wound

much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize

folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.

People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,

cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not

components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain

understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold

dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate

explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body

using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people

fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic
tolerance, rapid tolerance, metabolic tolerance, psychological tolerance.
keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,
pretty recent, journal "Pharmacology Biochemistry Behavior." Incidentally,

alcoholism not, whether not experienced drinker not, people initially
start drinking, increases dopamine, call dopaminergic

acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived

alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going

ingesting, again, somewhere between, average,

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great
clinical trial this. Well, may positive effects low level

anybody's anything. remiss, however, didn't tell resveratrol

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types

alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered

things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon

doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce

blackout drunk, people can passed drunk. also talked hangover
fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic

keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,

going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not

screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high

resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four

within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.

drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases

study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review

alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part

gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting

here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help

can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize

emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead

consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol

chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing

breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize

folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,

however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode
that. can find it, again, hubermanlab.com. direct links

showers ways leverage those, can find there. won't find
description use deliberate cold exposure sake treating hangover.
here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not
large robust literature, evidence pointing fact
levels epinephrine, adrenaline, raised brain bloodstream,
components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain

something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going

here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover

Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water

website really like just much useful information, assembled
list things proposed, purported improve, or, say,

there, isn't lot quality science support idea one compound can
eliminate hangover. probably hangover, again, arises multiple
organs tissues systems brain body. Nonetheless,
terrific list things, everything Japanese pear fruit juice
proposed this, really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.
Frankly, look literature elsewhere, one simply cannot find
magic substance, one herb, one potion can wipe away hangover. Getting rid

01:20:45 Types Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners

small number powerful things, already listed off few. However,
additional things one can relieving hangover, one
thoughtful sorts alcohol one consumes. find


interesting. actually studies types alcohol lead
greatest hangovers. actually lot legend lore well.
people said, instance, drinks high sugar content lead greater
hangovers. Turns not case, least not science points to.
look expected hangover severity, find bottom end
scale, drink not going tell you, moment, find
near is, instance, beer. consumption beer, provided not
overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal

drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can

call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve

metabolize things goal simply alleviate headache. lot kind
lore, old school lore relieve hangover. already talked
eating food won't eating food will prevent rapid absorption even
alcohol bloodstream. lore one simply ingest
alcohol. terrible advice is. just going delay even worse hangover.
However, remiss didn't say reason myth came be, that,
say, truth came be, indeed ingesting alcohol will alleviate
hangover worse hangover will show up, reason came
ingestion alcohol will cause constricted vessels giving
headache dilate again. But, course, ingesting alcohol relieve
hangover simply bad idea. Just don't it. think called hair dog
approach. Maybe someone can put show note captions YouTube
called hair dog. can come ideas not going
good ones, probably even outright ridiculous. not
ingest alcohol simply try recover hangover.

01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure

know many people tried one terrible idea. Now, one thing
also hear deliberate cold exposure, instance, taking cold
shower, might relieve hangover. find one particularly interesting
done episodes benefits deliberate cold exposure. entire episode
that. can find it, again, hubermanlab.com. direct links
tools related deliberate cold exposure entire newsletter
deliberate cold exposure protocols can find hubermanlab.com, go
Neural Network newsletter. interested ice baths cold
showers ways leverage those, can find there. won't find
description use deliberate cold exposure sake treating hangover.
here, went literature found something kind interesting.
evidence increasing levels epinephrine bloodstream can actually help
alcohol clearance. surprising me, want point not
large robust literature, evidence pointing fact
levels epinephrine, adrenaline, raised brain bloodstream,
components alcohol metabolism can accelerated inebriating


effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain
bloodstream, want clear want emphasize safety. way
understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold
exposure previously, talked normally, people not ingesting
alcohol, get ice bath cold shower body temperature initially
dips rebounds increases. process going occur
people not alcohol system. alcohol system, one
reasons become hypothermic disruption
hypothalamic brain areas, particular, brain area called medial preoptic area
regulates core body temperature. not much alcohol makes cold,
alcohol disrupts central command centers brain control
temperature regulation, leads slightly hypothermic. go
get cold lake get even cold shower ice bath,
possibility going very, far ladder hypothermic territory
can dangerous. Now, terms dealing hangover alcohol
largely cleared system, well, old lore
combines modern science says, well, can spike adrenaline,
certainly getting ice bath getting cold shower kind cold
body water, provided can safely, will sharply increase adrenaline
and, say, dopamine. shown talked
podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally
done immersion neck, again, safely, please, please, please, cold
shower getting shower much possible. cold? Well,
going vary person person. suggest making cold uncomfortable
really want get know can stay safely without,
instance, giving heart attack, water really, really cold,
course can give heart attack. showers won't go cold, although
probably will. Again, please use caution.

01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes

Spike adrenaline, spike dopamine deliberate cold exposure safely.
components hangover good targets trying alleviate hangover, and,
here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover
multifaceted phenomenon. not like one molecule one receptor. bunch
things happening brain body. dehydration associated alcohol?
Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water
also sodium. Sodium electrolyte critical function neurons, making sure
enough sodium, potassium, magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
going important proper brain function, bodily organ function. Even people
just one two drinks night before, likely electrolyte
balance fluid balance going disrupted, alcohol also
disrupts so-called vasopressin pathway. talked lot vasopressin way


interacts controls different aspects water retention water release

hubermanlab.com site can find episode salt balance ways
restore electrolyte balance. electrolytes proper levels
drink ideal. people will say every glass alcohol drink,

dehydrating effects alcohol, even better water electrolytes.
certainly set better day next day. don't manage
that, 'cause suppose kind geeky walking around electrolyte packets
bar whatnot, although, know, geeky, book, good thing, next day,
take electrolytes upon waking, maybe even go
sleep night drinking. hangover's made worse disturbed sleep, made worse
disrupted gut microbiome, made worse disrupted electrolytes, made worse
depletion epinephrine dopamine. replenishing microbiome
fermented foods, low-sugar fermented foods, is, using safe deliberate
cold exposure spiking adrenaline increasing dopamine,
consuming electrolytes going beneficial. folks examine.com,
website really like just much useful information, assembled
list things proposed, purported improve, or, say,
remove effects hangover, and, point like point
there, isn't lot quality science support idea one compound can
eliminate hangover. probably hangover, again, arises multiple
organs tissues systems brain body. Nonetheless,
terrific list things, everything Japanese pear fruit juice
proposed this, really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.
Frankly, look literature elsewhere, one simply cannot find
magic substance, one herb, one potion can wipe away hangover. Getting rid
hangover going best solved collection

01:20:45 Types Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners

small number powerful things, already listed off few. However,
additional things one can relieving hangover, one
thoughtful sorts alcohol one consumes. find


interesting. actually studies types alcohol lead
greatest hangovers. actually lot legend lore well.
people said, instance, drinks high sugar content lead greater
hangovers. Turns not case, least not science points to.
look expected hangover severity, find bottom end
scale, drink not going tell you, moment, find
near is, instance, beer. consumption beer, provided not
overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce
hangover. Again, within amounts comfortable person drink,
enough experience body weight tolerate without
getting very, drunk. point sugar causing hangover,
well, ethanol diluted orange juice probably top list

01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance

ask best way avoid hangover, not drink first
place. covered major effects alcohol lead state call
drunkenness inebriation. Again, range there. can tipsy, people can
blackout drunk, people can passed drunk. also talked hangover
fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic
tolerance, rapid tolerance, metabolic tolerance, psychological tolerance.
keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,

going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,

screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high

resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

effects alcohol can reduced, maybe old school lore taking cold shower
actually something it. thinking use deliberate cold exposure
order reduce effects hangover rapidly clear alcohol brain
bloodstream, want clear want emphasize safety. way
understand alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? can make
people slightly hypothermic. going drop core body temperature.
inebriated went got body water, right, pool lake
something, first all, extremely dangerous inebriated, right?
People drown time. People drown, die consequence that,
please don't that. also, cold water, core body temperature going
drop even further. Now, heard episodes done deliberate cold
exposure previously, talked normally, people not ingesting
alcohol, get ice bath cold shower body temperature initially
dips rebounds increases. process going occur
people not alcohol system. alcohol system, one
reasons become hypothermic disruption
hypothalamic brain areas, particular, brain area called medial preoptic area
regulates core body temperature. not much alcohol makes cold,
alcohol disrupts central command centers brain control
temperature regulation, leads slightly hypothermic. go
get cold lake get even cold shower ice bath,
possibility going very, far ladder hypothermic territory
can dangerous. Now, terms dealing hangover alcohol
largely cleared system, well, old lore
combines modern science says, well, can spike adrenaline,
certainly getting ice bath getting cold shower kind cold
body water, provided can safely, will sharply increase adrenaline
and, say, dopamine. shown talked
podcast before. get long, extended increases, several hours increases
dopamine deliberate cold exposure. well-documented humans, way.
one imagine using deliberate cold exposure way accelerate
recovery hangover. Provided done safely, think no reason not
explore that, wonder safely temperatures use, please
check episode deliberate cold exposure. Cold showers, therefore, might


actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally
done immersion neck, again, safely, please, please, please, cold
shower getting shower much possible. cold? Well,
going vary person person. suggest making cold uncomfortable
really want get know can stay safely without,
instance, giving heart attack, water really, really cold,
course can give heart attack. showers won't go cold, although
probably will. Again, please use caution.

01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes

Spike adrenaline, spike dopamine deliberate cold exposure safely.
components hangover good targets trying alleviate hangover, and,
here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover
multifaceted phenomenon. not like one molecule one receptor. bunch
things happening brain body. dehydration associated alcohol?
Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water
also sodium. Sodium electrolyte critical function neurons, making sure
enough sodium, potassium, magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
going important proper brain function, bodily organ function. Even people
just one two drinks night before, likely electrolyte
balance fluid balance going disrupted, alcohol also
disrupts so-called vasopressin pathway. talked lot vasopressin way


interacts controls different aspects water retention water release
body form urine episode salt. So, again, referring
hubermanlab.com site can find episode salt balance ways
restore electrolyte balance. electrolytes proper levels
drink ideal. people will say every glass alcohol drink,
drink one glass water. say better two glasses water given
dehydrating effects alcohol, even better water electrolytes.
certainly set better day next day. don't manage
that, 'cause suppose kind geeky walking around electrolyte packets
bar whatnot, although, know, geeky, book, good thing, next day,
take electrolytes upon waking, maybe even go
sleep night drinking. hangover's made worse disturbed sleep, made worse
disrupted gut microbiome, made worse disrupted electrolytes, made worse
depletion epinephrine dopamine. replenishing microbiome
fermented foods, low-sugar fermented foods, is, using safe deliberate
cold exposure spiking adrenaline increasing dopamine,
consuming electrolytes going beneficial. folks examine.com,
website really like just much useful information, assembled
list things proposed, purported improve, or, say,
remove effects hangover, and, point like point
there, isn't lot quality science support idea one compound can
eliminate hangover. probably hangover, again, arises multiple
organs tissues systems brain body. Nonetheless,
terrific list things, everything Japanese pear fruit juice
proposed this, really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.
Frankly, look literature elsewhere, one simply cannot find
magic substance, one herb, one potion can wipe away hangover. Getting rid
hangover going best solved collection

01:20:45 Types Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners

small number powerful things, already listed off few. However,
additional things one can relieving hangover, one
thoughtful sorts alcohol one consumes. find


interesting. actually studies types alcohol lead
greatest hangovers. actually lot legend lore well.
people said, instance, drinks high sugar content lead greater
hangovers. Turns not case, least not science points to.
look expected hangover severity, find bottom end
scale, drink not going tell you, moment, find
near is, instance, beer. consumption beer, provided not
overconsumption, right, not far beyond tolerance individual, one
two beers, less likely cause hangover than, say, whiskey. glass whiskey,
or, know, not much whiskey beer, course, glass whiskey,
instance, likely cause hangover gin, turns out. Again,
fallen data. yet glass rum red wine likely cause
hangover things mentioned far. top, top, top list
drinks induce hangover brandy. one say, "Well, doesn't brandy
lot sugar? Maybe sugar causing hangovers."
something been, again, discussed over, people say, "Oh,
high-sugar drinks cause hangover." turns out, however, one looks
alcoholic drinks sugar content hangover, bottom list is, gosh,
makes cringe just think about, ethanol diluted orange juice. Ugh, can't
believe people actually drink this, ethanol diluted orange juice. not vodka
orange juice, okay? Vodka third list bottom drinks induce
hangover. Again, within amounts comfortable person drink,
enough experience body weight tolerate without
getting very, drunk. point sugar causing hangover,
well, ethanol diluted orange juice probably top list
terms inducing hangover. not, bottom list, brandy
top list. find scales ethanol diluted orange juice
beer vodka gin, here, ascending hierarchy things cause hangover,
gin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine, brandy peak, sort
world heavyweight champion hangover-inducing drinks, well, increasing
congeners within drinks. Congeners things like nitrites substances
give alcohol distinctive flavor also lead inebriating effects
alcohol. Now, ask, "Okay, well, congeners doing?
nitrites doing?" guess what? effects


brain tissues, main effects disrupt gut microbiome.
points healthy gut microbiome perhaps ensuring
bolster gut microbiome day drinking going especially important
warding off hangover least reducing effects hangover symptoms
hangover both. love see study this. imagine designing
study myself, although isn't really sorts things laboratory does, can
imagine people getting probiotic prebiotic, regularly, just
drinking, low-sugar fermented foods, see effects terms
subjective effects hangover also physiological measures. think way
think hangover overall that, again, represents multifaceted, multi-organ,
multi-tissue phenomenon, best way deal multi-cell, multi-tissue,
multi-chemical phenomenon. listed off things one
order adjust hangover, again, one comes top list, believe,
least based read data, support gut microbiome certainly not

01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance

ask best way avoid hangover, not drink first
place. covered major effects alcohol lead state call
drunkenness inebriation. Again, range there. can tipsy, people can
blackout drunk, people can passed drunk. also talked hangover
fact multifaceted phenomenon recovery hangover involves
multifaceted approach. Next want talk tolerance. Tolerance alcohol
interesting phenomenon. roots mainly brain brain systems.
not time world, let alone within podcast, get aspects tolerance.
10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic
tolerance, rapid tolerance, metabolic tolerance, psychological tolerance.
keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,
pretty recent, journal "Pharmacology Biochemistry Behavior." Incidentally,
not incidentally, first journal ever published particular
affection journal. Nonetheless, called Tolerance alcohol: critical yet


understudied factor alcohol addiction. paper include alcohol
addiction title, not just alcohol addiction. basic summary
tolerance is. First all, tolerance refers reduced effects alcohol

old friend, meaning molecule comes
podcast episodes, dopamine. Whether not somebody predisposition
alcoholism not, whether not experienced drinker not, people initially
start drinking, increases dopamine, call dopaminergic
transmission. Dopamine involved motivation, craving, creates sense well-
being, increases energy, again, typically beginning alcohol exposure.
occurs people sharp spike, increase. Again, somebody not
alcohol dehydrogenase low levels enzyme convert
acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived
increase. soon after, actually triggered increase, long slow
reduction dopamine serotonin related molecules circuits. basically
getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow


reduction dopamine serotonin gets even longer. words, negative
effects alcohol happen initial feeling good, extend longer and, fact, get
robust. However, also reduction reinforcing properties alcohol.
shrinking feel good blip happens one first ingests alcohol,
measured animals humans. first drink somebody has,
provided enough alcohol dehydrogenase doesn't make feel
nauseous sick right away, feel really good. wears off, feel
kind lousy want drink might drink more.
subsequent drink, even drinks different nights even different weeks,
amount dopamine released reduced, amount serotonin released
reduced. getting less less reinforcing properties

like sex gambling behaviors can potentially become addictive
certainly includes alcohol. tolerance, seems, process people
ingesting alcohol attempt get feeling well-being back,
really getting extended period punishment, pain, malaise

alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red

consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great

well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent
increase shrinkage gray matter volume white matter tracts,

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication

drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase

trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

actually one way least partially relieve hangover. Certainly science
various places literature converged say that. But, again, careful, please,
please, please careful not get cold water inebriated.
absolutely dangerous obvious reasons, dangerous also
nonobvious reasons, not least dramatic decreases core body
temperature can make dangerously hypothermic. Now, go
using deliberate cold exposure accelerate recovery hangover? Well, there,
look kind standard protocols of, know, one three minutes maybe
even six minutes can tolerate it, really cold-adapted, maybe
seven ten minutes cold shower, although lot. people
going experience sharp increase epinephrine, adrenaline, long-lasting
increase dopamine one three minutes deliberate cold exposure, ideally
done immersion neck, again, safely, please, please, please, cold
shower getting shower much possible. cold? Well,
going vary person person. suggest making cold uncomfortable
really want get know can stay safely without,
instance, giving heart attack, water really, really cold,
course can give heart attack. showers won't go cold, although
probably will. Again, please use caution.

01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes

Spike adrenaline, spike dopamine deliberate cold exposure safely.
components hangover good targets trying alleviate hangover, and,
here, hope getting picture accurate say hangover

things happening brain body. dehydration associated alcohol?
Alcohol diuretic. multiple reasons, causes people excrete not water
also sodium. Sodium electrolyte critical function neurons, making sure
enough sodium, potassium, magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
going important proper brain function, bodily organ function. Even people
just one two drinks night before, likely electrolyte

10 different types tolerance. functional tolerance, chronic

keep simple sake today's discussion.
interested learning different types tolerance aspects tolerance,
excellent review, will provide link this. published 2021,
pretty recent, journal "Pharmacology Biochemistry Behavior." Incidentally,
not incidentally, first journal ever published particular
affection journal. Nonetheless, called Tolerance alcohol: critical yet


understudied factor alcohol addiction. paper include alcohol
addiction title, not just alcohol addiction. basic summary
tolerance is. First all, tolerance refers reduced effects alcohol
repeated exposure, caused mainly changes neurotransmitter systems
brain direct consequence toxicity alcohol, aldehyde
molecule talked before. enormous number chemicals
change repeated exposure acetaldehyde, everything GABA dopamine
serotonin, second messenger systems, adenosine, on. Rather go
detail, just want talk contour reinforcing
tolerance-inducing effects alcohol. mean that? Well, back
old friend, meaning molecule comes
podcast episodes, dopamine. Whether not somebody predisposition
alcoholism not, whether not experienced drinker not, people initially
start drinking, increases dopamine, call dopaminergic
transmission. Dopamine involved motivation, craving, creates sense well-
being, increases energy, again, typically beginning alcohol exposure.
occurs people sharp spike, increase. Again, somebody not
alcohol dehydrogenase low levels enzyme convert
acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived
increase. soon after, actually triggered increase, long slow
reduction dopamine serotonin related molecules circuits. basically
getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow


reduction dopamine serotonin gets even longer. words, negative
effects alcohol happen initial feeling good, extend longer and, fact, get
robust. However, also reduction reinforcing properties alcohol.
shrinking feel good blip happens one first ingests alcohol,
measured animals humans. first drink somebody has,
provided enough alcohol dehydrogenase doesn't make feel
nauseous sick right away, feel really good. wears off, feel
kind lousy want drink might drink more.
subsequent drink, even drinks different nights even different weeks,
amount dopamine released reduced, amount serotonin released
reduced. getting less less reinforcing properties
alcohol, feel good stuff, punishment pain signal aspects
alcohol. contour chemical release brain referred
colleague, incredible Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor. wrote
incredible book "Dopamine Nation." guest podcast, Joe Rogan's

like sex gambling behaviors can potentially become addictive
certainly includes alcohol. tolerance, seems, process people
ingesting alcohol attempt get feeling well-being back,
really getting extended period punishment, pain, malaise

turns behaviorally, say they, mean animals
humans this, start drinking attempt activate

afterwards well. bad news? Well, pretty much. good news
abstain drinking period time, then, course, systems reset.
long need abstain will depend much drinking long

alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going
try direct anyone's recovery. expert counselors MDs people
can work people. fact, heavy drinkers people serious
alcohol use disorder, going cold turkey, is, stopping drinking completely, can
actually medically dangerous. path sobriety certain people looks
different path sobriety people. referring people
ingesting, again, somewhere between, average,

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great
clinical trial this. Well, may positive effects low level
consumption. not trying take away anybody's red wine. not trying take away
anybody's anything. remiss, however, didn't tell resveratrol
argument drinking, drinking red wine particular,

01:35:42 Alcohol & Brain Thickness

things alcohol health. beginning episode, referenced study
showing indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption 12 24 drinks per

cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent

heavy drinkers, please everything can move away
quit entirely. even moderate consumers alcohol, going
want aware negative health effects things offset

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication

things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer

call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad

toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,

particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols

countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead

glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,

mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-

proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble

again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,

sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people

off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms

repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol

chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast

current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.

hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high

resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair

consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol

duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now

understudied factor alcohol addiction. paper include alcohol
addiction title, not just alcohol addiction. basic summary
tolerance is. First all, tolerance refers reduced effects alcohol
repeated exposure, caused mainly changes neurotransmitter systems
brain direct consequence toxicity alcohol, aldehyde
molecule talked before. enormous number chemicals
change repeated exposure acetaldehyde, everything GABA dopamine
serotonin, second messenger systems, adenosine, on. Rather go
detail, just want talk contour reinforcing
tolerance-inducing effects alcohol. mean that? Well, back
old friend, meaning molecule comes
podcast episodes, dopamine. Whether not somebody predisposition
alcoholism not, whether not experienced drinker not, people initially
start drinking, increases dopamine, call dopaminergic
transmission. Dopamine involved motivation, craving, creates sense well-
being, increases energy, again, typically beginning alcohol exposure.
occurs people sharp spike, increase. Again, somebody not
alcohol dehydrogenase low levels enzyme convert
acetaldehyde acetate metabolize alcohol, words, will feel sick
lousy way will override recognition dopamine release.
going people listening just thinking, "Alcohol just makes
feel sick. don't like it." Okay, specific subcategory people, people
experience sort mild euphoria. many people drink, right?
current estimates countries, certainly US, many 80%
adult, legal drinking age population drinks alcohol, number even
higher now last couple years, trend towards increased
alcohol consumption, especially wake pandemic pandemic.
Topic another time. increase dopamine increase serotonin,
kind increase well-being, increase mood, short-lived
increase. soon after, actually triggered increase, long slow
reduction dopamine serotonin related molecules circuits. basically
getting blip feel good followed long, slow arc feeling not great,
why, typically, people will drink across night. key thing
understand tolerance tolerance, duration long, slow


reduction dopamine serotonin gets even longer. words, negative
effects alcohol happen initial feeling good, extend longer and, fact, get
robust. However, also reduction reinforcing properties alcohol.
shrinking feel good blip happens one first ingests alcohol,
measured animals humans. first drink somebody has,
provided enough alcohol dehydrogenase doesn't make feel
nauseous sick right away, feel really good. wears off, feel
kind lousy want drink might drink more.
subsequent drink, even drinks different nights even different weeks,
amount dopamine released reduced, amount serotonin released
reduced. getting less less reinforcing properties
alcohol, feel good stuff, punishment pain signal aspects
alcohol. contour chemical release brain referred
colleague, incredible Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor. wrote
incredible book "Dopamine Nation." guest podcast, Joe Rogan's
podcast, Rich Roll's podcast several podcasts. World expert addiction,
talked pleasure-pain balance extends beyond alcohol things
like sex gambling behaviors can potentially become addictive
certainly includes alcohol. tolerance, seems, process people
ingesting alcohol attempt get feeling well-being back,
really getting extended period punishment, pain, malaise
alcohol. Now, might say, "Well, relate tolerance?" Well,
turns behaviorally, say they, mean animals
humans this, start drinking attempt activate
dopamine serotonin neurons receptors, that,
increase alcohol dehydrogenase, enzyme metabolizes alcohol increased
body liver contend alcohol, now got,
again, two-hit model. getting less feel good chemicals,
negative chemical release, pattern subjective feeling, say,
metabolizing alcohol quickly readily, not taking better
place terms feel. one major underlying reasons
call tolerance. somebody drinks notice feeling
seeking alcohol now requiring additional drink, drinks plural, chances
disrupting dopamine serotonergic systems brain,


way increasing pain punishment signals follow
alcohol ingestion. again, not just night drinking
afterwards well. bad news? Well, pretty much. good news
abstain drinking period time, then, course, systems reset.
long need abstain will depend much drinking long
drinking for. Certainly people alcohol use disorder
alcoholics, main goal quit alcohol completely. know
debate this, don't want get debate certainly not going
try direct anyone's recovery. expert counselors MDs people
can work people. fact, heavy drinkers people serious
alcohol use disorder, going cold turkey, is, stopping drinking completely, can
actually medically dangerous. path sobriety certain people looks
different path sobriety people. referring people
ingesting, again, somewhere between, average,

01:33:36 Positive Effects Alcohol?, Resveratrol

one two drinks per night, whether not done night night whether not
condensed weekend use. know number people going ask, perhaps
screaming, "Is drinking good way?" instance, many people
probably heard resveratrol good people red wine rich resveratrol.
hate break reality indeed resveratrol good us,
debate this, people say strongly yes, people say no,
people say maybe, amount red wine one drink order
get enough resveratrol order health promoting outrageously high
surely induce negative effects offset positive effects
resveratrol. wish tell different. Again, not bearer bad
news, statement just made confirmed Dr. David Sinclair
guest podcast. confirmed researchers work resveratrol
related pathways. wish tell red wine good health, indeed
might mechanisms. So, instance, studies
low moderate red wine consumption. anywhere one four
glasses per week. don't mean enormous glasses, mean six-ounce glasses red
wine. cases, stress reduction can induced


consumption red wine, maybe micronutrients components
within red wines, particular red wines come particular grapes, gets
really nuanced and, frankly, not well worked peer-reviewed literature
certainly not clinical trials, least not aware of. Tell aware great
clinical trial this. Well, may positive effects low level
consumption. not trying take away anybody's red wine. not trying take away
anybody's anything. remiss, however, didn't tell resveratrol
argument drinking, drinking red wine particular,

01:35:42 Alcohol & Brain Thickness

just not good one. just not supported peer-reviewed research.
things alcohol health. beginning episode, referenced study
showing indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption 12 24 drinks per
week, also light moderate alcohol consumption type, wine, beer, spirits, et
cetera, reduce thickness brain. really reduce cortical thickness.
fact, actually scales amount alcohol people drink,
well-documented number different studies. can provide link several these.
One striking ones actually shows almost dose-dependent
increase shrinkage gray matter volume white matter tracts,
axons, wires, were, connect different neurons function much
alcohol people drink. also seen recent study
referenced beginning show note captions. So, again, probably
best amount alcohol drink zero glasses per week ounces per week.
drinking low amounts alcohol, make sure things
promote health. drinking moderate certainly
heavy drinkers, please everything can move away
quit entirely. even moderate consumers alcohol, going
want aware negative health effects things offset

01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk

indeed not going stop drinking reduce intake. One really bad
effects alcohol, extremely well-documented, fact alcohol,


toxicity acetaldehyde related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,
can alter gene expression. can mean many things different tissues,
associated significant increase cancer risk, particular, breast cancer,
particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol


effects cells include changes gene expression, cancer, is, growth
tumors, dysregulation cell cycles, right? tumor aggregation
proliferation, aggregation stuff sticking together, way, proliferation stuff
duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-
cells, beats up. Cancers proliferate take hold cause serious problems
proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try
compare different substances terms bad are. Rarely compare
substances terms good are, sometimes do.
sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15
grams alcohol day, like one beer US one glass wine,
smoking 10 cigarettes day. Frankly, hard make direct
relationship really stick because, know, question of, know, long people
inhale, predisposition lung cancer, et cetera. even number
off plus minus two cigarettes, even number equivalent one
glass wine equals one cigarette per day... think general consensus now
nicotine consumed vaping cigarette, bad us terms lung cancer
forms cancer. reason, don't know why, knowledge
alcohol cancer established relationships known since


late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve
alcohol consumption. Again, point illustrate problems lie
alcohol consumption, but, also, tried point resources
can help offset negative effects. Will offset effects? can't
say sure, certainly taking measures offset negative effects
alcohol consumption might going beneficial

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical
students graduate students. set coordinated processes take place
conception birth order give rise healthy embryo so, dynamically
controlled exquisitely precise, checkpoints recovery mechanisms
redundancy genes expressed make sure anything goes wrong,


repaired, et cetera. Alcohol mutagen, haven't used word yet,
substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental
developing fetus. Lastly, want talk effects alcohol hormones,
want distinguish low amounts alcohol intake, higher amounts alcohol
intake, and, again, chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really
chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
hormones often get mentioned talked podcast
hormones testosterone estrogen, present men women
that, men women, important things like libido, also responsible


sexual development, actual development genitalia birth birth,
responsible, instance, estrogen important memory cognition.
never want drop estrogen low men women 'cause can disrupt cognition
joint health, et cetera. keep discussion relatively constrained, fair say
alcohol, and, particular, toxic metabolites alcohol, increase conversion
testosterone estrogen. Now, occurs number different tissues. not
just occurring testes males, occurring lots different tissues.
refer excellent review. provide link show note captions.
paper published year 2000 data still quite strong. journal
called, things, "Alcohol," yes, literally journal called "Alcohol" publication
data reviews alcohol effects, title paper Can alcohol
promote aromatization androgens estrogens? Aromatization process
conversion testosterone androgens estrogens things like
aromatase enzyme. beautiful review describes every tissue, near
every tissue, ovary females placenta liver testes,
alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. Now, females,
may part reason increase estrogen-related cancers. Breast
cancer can either estrogen-related non-estrogen-related, types
estrogen-related cancers outside breast cancer, appears one reason
alcohol increases risk breast cancer aromatization from,
testosterone, excuse me, estrogen. males, accelerated abnormal conversion
testosterone estrogen can actually lead growth breast tissue males, so-
called gynecomastia, effects high estrogen, say altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios, 'cause really important. can include
things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, number things
think people find negative effects. talked fact
drinking alcohol can increase aromatization testosterone estrogen. posted
online, didn't get attacked get criticized fact shown,
yes, shown, small amounts alcohol ingestion, five grams
alcohol ingestion, half glass wine half glass beer, least
studies showed increases testosterone, kind surprising.
point out, studies shown alcohol ingestion causes decreases
testosterone time. always issue whether not looking
study acute exposure versus chronic exposure, know, one dose versus multiple


doses exposure. think fair say, based read literature, review
reviews focus particularly humans, regular ingestion
alcohol going increase estrogen levels whether not male female,
largely aromatization process, increasing aromatase
enzyme. Yes, dose dependence, think somebody
trying optimize testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, regardless whether not
male female,

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.
covered lot topics data related mechanisms alcohol, hangover,
tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera. acknowledge mainly talked
negative effects alcohol. want acknowledge many people enjoy alcohol
moderation even light drinking, occasional drink occasional two drinks
maybe even, average, one drink per night, seven drinks per week. certainly not
tell not do. find immensely interesting,
however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.
might immediately say, "Well, wait, hormesis? phenomenon
regularly ingest toxin, makes us stronger?" words, doesn't
kill us makes us stronger. Yeah, there's, know, reason believe might
beneficial terms forms cellular resilience maybe, maybe. No, sorry.
doesn't work way. processes hormesis which, instance, exposing
safely increases adrenaline through, know, ice baths
things increase adrenaline can raise so-called stress threshold, here,
talking cellular stress damage cells. read literature, and,
again, read invite others to, know, provide studies prefer
actually collections studies point direction, exist, alcohol can
beneficial, read literature, say understanding
call center mass literature alcohol no consumption, zero
consumption, consumption zero ounces alcohol going better health
low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol
consumption order 12 24 drinks per week. realize


people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative
effects alcohol gut microbiome things can better support
gut microbiome, negative effects stress system, HPA axis
talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol
consumption can increase levels stress not drinking, think
acquiring tools and, know, getting proficiency tools,
behavioral otherwise, can help stress modulation don't involve

particular, breast tissue present males females, women,
especially vulnerable DNA methylation changes, well, breast cancer
women relationship alcohol intake, alcohol intake relationship
breast cancer women. fact, proposed anywhere 4
13% increase risk breast cancer every 10 grams alcohol consumed.
much 10 grams? Well, there, need think little bit variation
amount alcohol different drinks across world. Different countries serve
different sized drinks different concentrations alcohol drinks.
without going much rabbit hole just giving good rules
thumb work with, studies percentage alcohol included
different drinks sizes different drinks served different countries,
kind patchwork findings. Japan, one beer, one glass wine,
one shot liquor, served there, tends include anywhere seven eight
grams alcohol. US, one beer, generally 12 ounces bottle, one
glass wine shot liquor tends include 10 12 grams alcohol.
Russia, one drink various sorts just described typically will much
24 grams alcohol differences concentration alcohols
sizes drinks poured different countries, okay? course,
countries world, countries also vitally important,
ones extracted studies find. mean? Well,
talking every 10 grams alcohol consumed, one beer
US, maybe little bit one beer Japan, basically third drink
Russia, 4 13% increase risk cancer. pretty outrageous, right?
might think, "Wait, that, know, stuff even legal?" Well,
look, described before, toxin. also toxin people enjoy effects of.
mean, US least, tried prohibition. certainly lead, yes, lead
reduction alcohol-induced health disorders, particular, cirrhosis liver. also
led lot crime became substance lot people still wanted
people willing break law order provide, or, say, sell
provide. point alcohol people drink, greater increase
cancer, particular, breast cancer. fact alcohol

duplicating, proliferation aggregation cells glioma, glial cells,
glioma brain tumor, right? lymphoma, within lymph tissue, et cetera.
mutations alcohol induces cause wide ranging,
starting understood. interested cell biology, just
mention PD-1 pathway, again, super specialized aficionados
only, don't need know this, PD-1 pathway seems upregulated and,
knew discussion earlier, downregulation anti-
inflammatory molecules help suppress proliferation cancers. Nowadays,
lot interest fact immune system constantly combating
cancers exist us time. know, little tumors start growing
immune system goes gobbles up. Little tumors start growing, immune
system senses inflammation, sends incredible cells, killer B-cells T-

proliferation cells exceeds immune system's ability gobble
remove cells. mechanisms regulating cancers, one
primary one. alcohol hits it. Again, two hit model. increases tumor growth
decreases sorts molecules suppress combat tumor growth. So,
again, even low moderate amounts alcohol can problematic sake cancers,
particular, breast cancers. Epidemiologists health specialists love try

sometimes tell can find literature ingesting 10 15

folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially

01:55:09 Negative Effects Alcohol Consumption

well certainly going want avoid drinking much alcohol.

however, that, first all, alcohol known toxin cells body.

low moderate consumption alcohol, low moderate consumption
alcohol going better you, course, moderately high high alcohol

people listening this, probably low moderate alcohol consumption part
standard repertoire, not give justification
going tell not that. like consider perhaps, however,
negative effects understand documented. instance, negative

talked earlier, fact even low moderate levels alcohol

late 1980s. first, know, landmark paper published 1987. can
provide link paper. actually quite interesting read. Well, relationship
yet don't often hear it, right? fact, researching episode,
heard alcohol can increase cancer risk wasn't aware just
strong relationship is. serious nature talking
hate confusing misleading anybody, want just emphasize
statistic, 4 13%, depending study look at, 4
13% increase risk cancer, particular, breast cancer, every 10 grams
alcohol consumed, 10 grams per day, one drink per day. want
emphasize equates seven drinks per week

01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins

seven drinks consumed Friday Saturday, still averages
10 grams per day. also want emphasize things people can
least partially offset negative effects alcohol relates
predisposition formation certain kinds tumors cancers. also want
clear say things tell not guarantee
not going get cancer, guarantee alcohol not going lead
increased predisposition certain kinds cancers, two things
consumption folate B vitamins, especially B12. know, consumption
folate B12 shown decrease cancer risk people ingest alcohol,
not completely offset it. isn't exactly clear. probably something
relationship folate B12 B vitamins gene regulation
pathways can lead tumor growth. point soon, will get expert
cancer biology, and, particular, breast cancer biology, program can
ask this. realize going raise number questions maybe
even cause go start taking folate B vitamins
B12. Not incidentally, lot reported hangover supplements treatments include
folate B12. don't know cancer literature mind created
supplements products. doubt did. Alcohol really disrupt B vitamin
pathways, synthesis pathways utilization pathways, sometimes hear,
"Oh, know, get B vitamins, helps recover hangover
quickly." Again, literature doesn't support that, also again, aren't lot


studies. point relates alcohol formation tumors
cancers, appear decreased folate B vitamins like B12 partially
responsible effect alcohol increasing cancer risk. appear
consuming adequate amounts folate B12 might, again, might partially, really want
bold face

01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

underline highlight partially, offset increased risk.
additional category want highlight, course, vitally important state
even though obvious, people pregnant absolutely not
consume alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome well known established, terrible.
Fetuses experience diminished brain development often permanent, diminished
limb development, diminished organ development periphery, meaning, know,
heart, lungs, liver, et cetera. Ingesting alcohol pregnant simply bad
idea. reason say is, first all, important include episode
like this, also can look two things. First all, can look
mechanism can also look lore still sadly exists there.
take care lore sadly exists first. look online, will sometimes
able find, sadly, people believe certain kinds alcohol not
detrimental fetuses. say, "Well, champagne safe pregnant mother
drink beer not." absolutely categorically false. Alcohol alcohol.
no evidence whatsoever consuming certain types alcohol safer fetuses
others. Alcohol toxin, reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
ability toxin disrupt cellular processes. Remember tumor growth way
alcohol can accelerate tumor growth proliferation cells, wrong cells,
ones don't want proliferate? Well, embryonic development, fetal
development, not growth tumor, obviously growth embryo,
done orchestrated way. started off studying brain development.
got beginnings neurobiology, still teach embryology medical

substance can mutate DNA alterations DNA methylation
checkpoints cell cycle, alcohol mutagen one worst things
developing embryo can exposed to. And, again, water-soluble fat-
soluble, ingestion alcohol people pregnant passes right fetus. Now,
realize number people might thinking, "Oh goodness, know,
didn't realize pregnant certain stage pregnancy, realized,
ingesting alcohol." Obviously, one can't undo done, want also
emphasize fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, full-blown syndrome
manifests changes cranial facial development obvious,
can look up, probably seen before, pictures before, rather,
eye spacing, forehead size, number features cranial
facial development, course stuff's going brain too, along
continuum. possible changes occur minor, and,
thankfully, young brain, particular, early postnatal brain, incredibly plastic.
things can done order help recover neural circuits didn't
develop well, et cetera. even though somewhat obvious, obvious,
really want make clear zero evidence whatsoever certain forms
alcohol safer pregnant women ingest others. Absolutely wrong, no one
pregnant ingesting alcohol whatsoever. certainly, people feel like
can't avoid alcohol pregnant, really need work somebody

01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance

make sure just absolutely doesn't happen detrimental

chronic use, meaning alcoholic alcoholic use disorder, people drinking
immense amount ongoing basis. literature alcohol hormones quite
extensive, are, course, many, many different types hormones.
