00:05:06 Emotions, Addiction & Mindset

hope expand languages near future. month,
talking neuroscience emotions today going talk
extremely important topic central daily life motivation. going
talk pleasure reward. underlies sense pleasure reward.
going talk addictions. can't discussion pleasure
reward without discussion addictions addictive properties
certain substances well break free addiction. well going talk
neurochemistry drive mindset. themes woven together


context emotions. one course also entire
month podcast fact, going entire month devoted
addiction special guest going joining us talk
science clinical practices know important understanding treating
addiction. now, just talk neuroscience motivation reward
pleasure pain central think emotions whether
not feel good, whether not feel track life whether not feel
falling behind.

00:06:22 Motivation & Movement: Dopamine Connection

motivation fundamental daily life. allows us get bed
morning. allows us pursue long-term goals short-term goals, motivation
chemistry motivation tightly wound neurochemistry movement.
fact, single molecule ,dopamine responsible sense motivation
movement, even though nerves controlling muscles. again, nerves
spinal cord brain move limbs, effector chemical one
actually causes muscles twitch contract, CDOT Colleen brain.
Acetylcholine responsible focus. However, whether not move, whether not
want move whether not desire overcome barriers
social barriers financial barriers time constraints. depends
molecule. call dopamine, fascinating molecule lies center
many great things life lies center

00:07:29 Double-Edged Dopamine Blade

many terrible aspects life namely addiction certain forms mental disease.
ever double-edged blade world neuroscience dopamine.
talk dopamine always going talk actionable
tools today. definitely gonna talk things related supplementation.
Although might surprised learn not just increasing dopamine
particular, cases wrong thing do. Sometimes appropriate
sometimes not. going talk tools related called
dopamine scheduling, way leading life way


conceptualizing goals can actually predict whether not going continue
pursue goals. therefore whether not will succeed achieving
goals well whether not will quit. fundamental relationship
dopamine released brain desire exert effort. can actually
control schedule dopamine release requires appropriate knowledge.
one cases understanding way dopamine system works will
allow leverage benefit. don't understand way
dopamine works good chance going pull current
life. Meaning rest world going control dopamine schedules.
excited tell today's information. gonna learn basic science.
gonna learn lot tools tools believe applicable whether not
five years old

00:08:56 Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor Adrenalin

eight years old, 80 years older, anything between. talk dopamine.
get basic facts table. Dopamine discovered late 1950s
discovered precursor, meaning thing epinephrin adrenaline
made. Now fundamentally important molecule call dopamine
nowadays, think molecule reward pleasure, actually
substrate adrenaline made brain substrate
epinephrin made epinephrin thing adrenaline except brain
call epinephrin. Epinephrin may recall previous podcasts, haven't
no problem epinephrin allows us get action. stimulates changes blood
vessels, heart organs tissues body bias us movement.
like learn epinephrin can check episode
mastering stress. talk lot there. Dopamine initially thought just
building block epinephrin. indeed chemical building block
epinephrin made. However, dopamine lot things own. not always
converted epinephrin. Dopamine released several sites

00:10:15 Reward Pathway: Accelerator & Brake

brain body, perhaps important one today's discussion


motivation reward something sometimes just called reward pathway
sometimes called mesolimbic reward pathway fundamentally important
desire engage action fundamentally important people getting
addicted substances behaviors. work? Well, got
structure deep part brain called VTA. stands ventral tegmental
area. always don't remember names, want offer
food googling, research, reading, et cetera, VTA ventral
tegmental area contains neurons send call axons little wires spit
dopamine different structure called nucleus accumbens two structures
VTA nucleus accumbens form really core machinery reward pathway
pathway controls motivation anything can think like
accelerator bias action. However, within reward pathway, also
break break restriction dopamine controls released
much released prefrontal cortex. prefrontal cortex neural real
estate right behind forehead. discussed many aspects neuroscience.
hear decision-making , executive function ,for planning, et cetera.
indeed responsible lot those. really unique real estate
endowed humans, animals don't much it. lot
prefrontal cortex acts brake dopamine system without break
purely pleasure seeking animal. purely pleasure seeking.
no basis regulating behavior

00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain

terms trying get things make feel good. brings us
important feature motivation motivation two-part process
balancing pleasure pain. Okay. people think motivation
reward dopamine just trying achieve pleasure. indeed dopamine
released brain VTA the* nucleus accumbens. experience
things like. way conceptualize can internalize
mind will really help move day trying understand
might motivated not motivated certain things. just
sitting around, not much anything, maybe wake bed morning.
thinking getting not. reward pathway releasing dopamine


rate three four times per second. kind firing low level. say
firing electrical activity neurons. just around, feel okay,
not depressed not highly motivated, not excited maybe three four times second.
suddenly get excited something anticipate something, not receive
award get excited anticipatory way. rate firing rate
activity reward pathway suddenly increases like 30 40 times
effect creating sense action desire move direction thing
craving. fact, fair say dopamine responsible wanting
craving, distinctly different way hear talked normally
involved pleasure. yes, dopamine released response sex.
released response food. released response lot things mostly
released anticipation craving particular thing. effect narrowing
focus thing crave thing simple cup coffee.
important big board meeting. big, final exam.

00:14:14 Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

a, person excited meet see dopamine doesn't care
craving. just releases particular rate. fact, just take step back
look scientific data much dopamine firing increases
response different things, get pretty interesting window brain
works might motivated not motivated. say hungry,
looking forward cup coffee, going see partner. Well,
dopamine neurons firing low rate start thinking thing
want thing looking forward say craving chocolate
good meal, steak like steak nice plate pasta like pasta,
eat food amount dopamine released reward pathway goes
50% baseline. neurons go firing, three four times per
second to, six 10 times per second. really depends aren't exact numbers.
measure amount dopamine released, goes 50
points, right. Sex, fundamental species, continuation reproduction.
Although doesn't conceiving children. Sex release dopamine
increases dopamine levels hundred percent. basically doubles them.
Nicotine sort cigarettes people taking nicotine


supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms
talked previous podcasts gives us sort balance pleasure seeking
offsetting pain pleasure now. pleasure really two things.
joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every
gives wind keep playing. the, probability winning
craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing
invest time energy order achieve goals rewards may
reach. never really know going succeed. make crystal clear,
celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn



01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

context emotions. one course also entire
month podcast fact, going entire month devoted
addiction special guest going joining us talk
science clinical practices know important understanding treating
addiction. now, just talk neuroscience motivation reward
pleasure pain central think emotions whether
not feel good, whether not feel track life whether not feel
falling behind.

00:06:22 Motivation & Movement: Dopamine Connection

motivation fundamental daily life. allows us get bed
morning. allows us pursue long-term goals short-term goals, motivation
chemistry motivation tightly wound neurochemistry movement.
fact, single molecule ,dopamine responsible sense motivation
movement, even though nerves controlling muscles. again, nerves
spinal cord brain move limbs, effector chemical one
actually causes muscles twitch contract, CDOT Colleen brain.
Acetylcholine responsible focus. However, whether not move, whether not
want move whether not desire overcome barriers
social barriers financial barriers time constraints. depends
molecule. call dopamine, fascinating molecule lies center
many great things life lies center

00:07:29 Double-Edged Dopamine Blade

many terrible aspects life namely addiction certain forms mental disease.
ever double-edged blade world neuroscience dopamine.
talk dopamine always going talk actionable
tools today. definitely gonna talk things related supplementation.
Although might surprised learn not just increasing dopamine
particular, cases wrong thing do. Sometimes appropriate
sometimes not. going talk tools related called
dopamine scheduling, way leading life way


conceptualizing goals can actually predict whether not going continue
pursue goals. therefore whether not will succeed achieving
goals well whether not will quit. fundamental relationship
dopamine released brain desire exert effort. can actually
control schedule dopamine release requires appropriate knowledge.
one cases understanding way dopamine system works will
allow leverage benefit. don't understand way
dopamine works good chance going pull current
life. Meaning rest world going control dopamine schedules.
excited tell today's information. gonna learn basic science.
gonna learn lot tools tools believe applicable whether not
five years old

00:08:56 Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor Adrenalin

eight years old, 80 years older, anything between. talk dopamine.
get basic facts table. Dopamine discovered late 1950s
discovered precursor, meaning thing epinephrin adrenaline
made. Now fundamentally important molecule call dopamine
nowadays, think molecule reward pleasure, actually
substrate adrenaline made brain substrate
epinephrin made epinephrin thing adrenaline except brain
call epinephrin. Epinephrin may recall previous podcasts, haven't
no problem epinephrin allows us get action. stimulates changes blood
vessels, heart organs tissues body bias us movement.
like learn epinephrin can check episode
mastering stress. talk lot there. Dopamine initially thought just
building block epinephrin. indeed chemical building block
epinephrin made. However, dopamine lot things own. not always
converted epinephrin. Dopamine released several sites

00:10:15 Reward Pathway: Accelerator & Brake

brain body, perhaps important one today's discussion


motivation reward something sometimes just called reward pathway
sometimes called mesolimbic reward pathway fundamentally important
desire engage action fundamentally important people getting
addicted substances behaviors. work? Well, got
structure deep part brain called VTA. stands ventral tegmental
area. always don't remember names, want offer
food googling, research, reading, et cetera, VTA ventral
tegmental area contains neurons send call axons little wires spit
dopamine different structure called nucleus accumbens two structures
VTA nucleus accumbens form really core machinery reward pathway
pathway controls motivation anything can think like
accelerator bias action. However, within reward pathway, also
break break restriction dopamine controls released
much released prefrontal cortex. prefrontal cortex neural real
estate right behind forehead. discussed many aspects neuroscience.
hear decision-making , executive function ,for planning, et cetera.
indeed responsible lot those. really unique real estate
endowed humans, animals don't much it. lot
prefrontal cortex acts brake dopamine system without break
purely pleasure seeking animal. purely pleasure seeking.
no basis regulating behavior

00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain

terms trying get things make feel good. brings us
important feature motivation motivation two-part process
balancing pleasure pain. Okay. people think motivation
reward dopamine just trying achieve pleasure. indeed dopamine
released brain VTA the* nucleus accumbens. experience
things like. way conceptualize can internalize
mind will really help move day trying understand
might motivated not motivated certain things. just
sitting around, not much anything, maybe wake bed morning.
thinking getting not. reward pathway releasing dopamine


rate three four times per second. kind firing low level. say
firing electrical activity neurons. just around, feel okay,
not depressed not highly motivated, not excited maybe three four times second.
suddenly get excited something anticipate something, not receive
award get excited anticipatory way. rate firing rate
activity reward pathway suddenly increases like 30 40 times
effect creating sense action desire move direction thing
craving. fact, fair say dopamine responsible wanting
craving, distinctly different way hear talked normally
involved pleasure. yes, dopamine released response sex.
released response food. released response lot things mostly
released anticipation craving particular thing. effect narrowing
focus thing crave thing simple cup coffee.
important big board meeting. big, final exam.

00:14:14 Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

a, person excited meet see dopamine doesn't care
craving. just releases particular rate. fact, just take step back
look scientific data much dopamine firing increases
response different things, get pretty interesting window brain
works might motivated not motivated. say hungry,
looking forward cup coffee, going see partner. Well,
dopamine neurons firing low rate start thinking thing
want thing looking forward say craving chocolate
good meal, steak like steak nice plate pasta like pasta,
eat food amount dopamine released reward pathway goes
50% baseline. neurons go firing, three four times per
second to, six 10 times per second. really depends aren't exact numbers.
measure amount dopamine released, goes 50
points, right. Sex, fundamental species, continuation reproduction.
Although doesn't conceiving children. Sex release dopamine
increases dopamine levels hundred percent. basically doubles them.
Nicotine sort cigarettes people taking nicotine


supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.

dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence

prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major

check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report

it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo

positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad

conceptualizing goals can actually predict whether not going continue
pursue goals. therefore whether not will succeed achieving
goals well whether not will quit. fundamental relationship
dopamine released brain desire exert effort. can actually
control schedule dopamine release requires appropriate knowledge.
one cases understanding way dopamine system works will
allow leverage benefit. don't understand way
dopamine works good chance going pull current
life. Meaning rest world going control dopamine schedules.
excited tell today's information. gonna learn basic science.
gonna learn lot tools tools believe applicable whether not
five years old

00:08:56 Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor Adrenalin

eight years old, 80 years older, anything between. talk dopamine.
get basic facts table. Dopamine discovered late 1950s
discovered precursor, meaning thing epinephrin adrenaline
made. Now fundamentally important molecule call dopamine
nowadays, think molecule reward pleasure, actually
substrate adrenaline made brain substrate
epinephrin made epinephrin thing adrenaline except brain
call epinephrin. Epinephrin may recall previous podcasts, haven't
no problem epinephrin allows us get action. stimulates changes blood
vessels, heart organs tissues body bias us movement.
like learn epinephrin can check episode
mastering stress. talk lot there. Dopamine initially thought just
building block epinephrin. indeed chemical building block
epinephrin made. However, dopamine lot things own. not always
converted epinephrin. Dopamine released several sites

00:10:15 Reward Pathway: Accelerator & Brake

brain body, perhaps important one today's discussion


motivation reward something sometimes just called reward pathway
sometimes called mesolimbic reward pathway fundamentally important
desire engage action fundamentally important people getting
addicted substances behaviors. work? Well, got
structure deep part brain called VTA. stands ventral tegmental
area. always don't remember names, want offer
food googling, research, reading, et cetera, VTA ventral
tegmental area contains neurons send call axons little wires spit
dopamine different structure called nucleus accumbens two structures
VTA nucleus accumbens form really core machinery reward pathway
pathway controls motivation anything can think like
accelerator bias action. However, within reward pathway, also
break break restriction dopamine controls released
much released prefrontal cortex. prefrontal cortex neural real
estate right behind forehead. discussed many aspects neuroscience.
hear decision-making , executive function ,for planning, et cetera.
indeed responsible lot those. really unique real estate
endowed humans, animals don't much it. lot
prefrontal cortex acts brake dopamine system without break
purely pleasure seeking animal. purely pleasure seeking.
no basis regulating behavior

00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain

terms trying get things make feel good. brings us
important feature motivation motivation two-part process
balancing pleasure pain. Okay. people think motivation
reward dopamine just trying achieve pleasure. indeed dopamine
released brain VTA the* nucleus accumbens. experience
things like. way conceptualize can internalize
mind will really help move day trying understand
might motivated not motivated certain things. just
sitting around, not much anything, maybe wake bed morning.
thinking getting not. reward pathway releasing dopamine


rate three four times per second. kind firing low level. say
firing electrical activity neurons. just around, feel okay,
not depressed not highly motivated, not excited maybe three four times second.
suddenly get excited something anticipate something, not receive
award get excited anticipatory way. rate firing rate
activity reward pathway suddenly increases like 30 40 times
effect creating sense action desire move direction thing
craving. fact, fair say dopamine responsible wanting
craving, distinctly different way hear talked normally
involved pleasure. yes, dopamine released response sex.
released response food. released response lot things mostly
released anticipation craving particular thing. effect narrowing
focus thing crave thing simple cup coffee.
important big board meeting. big, final exam.

00:14:14 Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

a, person excited meet see dopamine doesn't care
craving. just releases particular rate. fact, just take step back
look scientific data much dopamine firing increases
response different things, get pretty interesting window brain
works might motivated not motivated. say hungry,
looking forward cup coffee, going see partner. Well,
dopamine neurons firing low rate start thinking thing
want thing looking forward say craving chocolate
good meal, steak like steak nice plate pasta like pasta,
eat food amount dopamine released reward pathway goes
50% baseline. neurons go firing, three four times per
second to, six 10 times per second. really depends aren't exact numbers.
measure amount dopamine released, goes 50
points, right. Sex, fundamental species, continuation reproduction.
Although doesn't conceiving children. Sex release dopamine
increases dopamine levels hundred percent. basically doubles them.
Nicotine sort cigarettes people taking nicotine


supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms
talked previous podcasts gives us sort balance pleasure seeking
offsetting pain pleasure now. pleasure really two things.
joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.

Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every
gives wind keep playing. the, probability winning
craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing
invest time energy order achieve goals rewards may
reach. never really know going succeed. make crystal clear,
celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn



01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

motivation reward something sometimes just called reward pathway
sometimes called mesolimbic reward pathway fundamentally important
desire engage action fundamentally important people getting
addicted substances behaviors. work? Well, got
structure deep part brain called VTA. stands ventral tegmental
area. always don't remember names, want offer
food googling, research, reading, et cetera, VTA ventral
tegmental area contains neurons send call axons little wires spit
dopamine different structure called nucleus accumbens two structures
VTA nucleus accumbens form really core machinery reward pathway
pathway controls motivation anything can think like
accelerator bias action. However, within reward pathway, also
break break restriction dopamine controls released
much released prefrontal cortex. prefrontal cortex neural real
estate right behind forehead. discussed many aspects neuroscience.
hear decision-making , executive function ,for planning, et cetera.
indeed responsible lot those. really unique real estate
endowed humans, animals don't much it. lot
prefrontal cortex acts brake dopamine system without break
purely pleasure seeking animal. purely pleasure seeking.
no basis regulating behavior

00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain

terms trying get things make feel good. brings us
important feature motivation motivation two-part process
balancing pleasure pain. Okay. people think motivation
reward dopamine just trying achieve pleasure. indeed dopamine
released brain VTA the* nucleus accumbens. experience
things like. way conceptualize can internalize
mind will really help move day trying understand
might motivated not motivated certain things. just
sitting around, not much anything, maybe wake bed morning.
thinking getting not. reward pathway releasing dopamine


rate three four times per second. kind firing low level. say
firing electrical activity neurons. just around, feel okay,
not depressed not highly motivated, not excited maybe three four times second.
suddenly get excited something anticipate something, not receive
award get excited anticipatory way. rate firing rate
activity reward pathway suddenly increases like 30 40 times
effect creating sense action desire move direction thing
craving. fact, fair say dopamine responsible wanting
craving, distinctly different way hear talked normally
involved pleasure. yes, dopamine released response sex.
released response food. released response lot things mostly
released anticipation craving particular thing. effect narrowing
focus thing crave thing simple cup coffee.
important big board meeting. big, final exam.

00:14:14 Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

a, person excited meet see dopamine doesn't care
craving. just releases particular rate. fact, just take step back
look scientific data much dopamine firing increases
response different things, get pretty interesting window brain
works might motivated not motivated. say hungry,
looking forward cup coffee, going see partner. Well,
dopamine neurons firing low rate start thinking thing
want thing looking forward say craving chocolate
good meal, steak like steak nice plate pasta like pasta,
eat food amount dopamine released reward pathway goes
50% baseline. neurons go firing, three four times per
second to, six 10 times per second. really depends aren't exact numbers.
measure amount dopamine released, goes 50
points, right. Sex, fundamental species, continuation reproduction.
Although doesn't conceiving children. Sex release dopamine
increases dopamine levels hundred percent. basically doubles them.
Nicotine sort cigarettes people taking nicotine


supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase

schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified

avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate

indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously

00:14:14 Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

a, person excited meet see dopamine doesn't care
craving. just releases particular rate. fact, just take step back
look scientific data much dopamine firing increases

measure amount dopamine released, goes 50
points, right. Sex, fundamental species, continuation reproduction.
Although doesn't conceiving children. Sex release dopamine
increases dopamine levels hundred percent. basically doubles them.
Nicotine sort cigarettes people taking nicotine


supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.

dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different

actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.

exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo

release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent

aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration

supplemental form increases amount dopamine 150% baseline.
also things gonna talk about, nicotine
kind interesting nicotine increase amount dopamine brain
quick, within seconds 150 times baseline opposed sex
100 percent food 50%. Cocaine amphetamine increase
amount

00:16:15 Subjective Control Dopamine Release

dopamine released thousand fold within 10 seconds consuming
drug. However, just thinking food, sex, nicotine like nicotine
cocaine amphetamine can increase amount dopamine released
degree actually consuming drug. Now depends cases,
instance cocaine user, addict wants cocaine can't just think cocaine
increase amount released thousand fold actually much lower
just enough put motivation track crave particular thing.
Now, reasons brain circuitry like this. mean, brain
circuitry like didn't evolve get addicted brain circuitry like evolved order
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water thirsty , sex order
reproduce gonna talk relationship estrogen
testosterone dopamine system hormones actually bias dopamine
released. things brain areas neurons part
evolutionary history led continuation species. Things like cocaine
amphetamine disastrous people really much dopamine
create closed loops people crave particular thing,
cocaine, amphetamine leads massive amounts dopamine release.

00:17:40 Social Media Video Games

things don't release level dopamine. Now, nowadays ton interest
social media video games measurements
amount dopamine released video games especially video games high
update speed novel territory time not novelty big stimulus
dopamine. can release dopamine somewhere nicotine cocaine.


high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,

habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness

children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded

gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every

occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music

avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point

realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms

01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward

high levels dopamine release. Social media interesting one
amount dopamine released response logging

00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

onto social media initially quite high seems like likely taper
amount dopamine yet people still get addicted. why,
can get addicted things fail get elicit massive amount pleasure
initially did. addicted something isn't just fact feels
good wanna pleasure pain
balance underlies motivation. look little bit closer pleasure pain
balance lies tools able control motivation

00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

toward healthy things avoid motivated behaviors towards things destructive
you. lot reasons people try novel behaviors whether not
drugs whether not adventure, thrill-seeking things seek
new partners take new class notice. not placing judgment
value different behaviors. Although think fair point
people addictive drugs like cocaine amphetamine destructive. Actually
know 15 20% people genetic bias towards addiction ,
sometimes hear first time use drug can become addicted it.
actually not shown true things people,
people actually true. talk little bit later certain people
heavily biased toward becoming addicts first use particular drug. actually
interesting, everything whether not formerly addicted
something else case, way addiction works way
motivation works generally non-addictive setting anticipate
something little bit dopamine released, reach thing,
engaged thing amount dopamine goes even
repeatedly pursue behavior repeatedly engage particular thing say
love running



00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms
talked previous podcasts gives us sort balance pleasure seeking
offsetting pain pleasure now. pleasure really two things.
joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment

children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded

00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

love chocolate eat piece chocolate believe not, tastes good
shift away activation dopamine. chemicals
released trigger low level sense pain. Now might not feel physical
pain craving feel one part dopamine one part, mirror
image dopamine pain craving yet another piece chocolate.
important subtle feature dopamine system. not often
discussed. People always talk just pleasure. love social media. gives
dopamine. engage that. like chocolate, releases dopamine.
that. every bit dopamine released another circuit
brain creates can think kind like downward deflection pleasure.
engage something really want increase pleasure.
without anything mirror image downward
deflection pleasure calling pain. every bit pleasure
mirror image experience pain overlap time closely. sometimes
hard sense try next time eat something really delicious. take
bite, tastes delicious part experience want thing.
true pleasureful experience. Now, diabolical part dopamine
didn't evolve order get indulge
something, happens initially experience increase pleasure
also experience increase pain shortly woven pleasure
makes want thing. subsequent time encounter
thing pursue, chocolate pursue lover time,
experience dopamine release pleasure diminished little bit. diabolical
thing pain response increased little bit best observed
context drug seeking behavior. first time someone decides take cocaine
amphetamine, may boredom. may peer pressure.
may relieve internal sense. Maybe bored, just excited.
Maybe high novel novelty seeking. lot reasons people
might try drug far many us get parks here. Maybe don't even
wanna someone encourages them. will experience huge dopamine
release will feel likely good. However, next time take won't feel
quite good. won't feel even good third time next time,


amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence

prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major

actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive

cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now

things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience

clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad

achievements powerful way ensure will stay path
pursuit. point podcast like take moment address
corrections. made errors previous episodes. weren't major errors
couple pointed important strive accuracy.
first one talked previous episode potential benefits
people, not ashwagandha role blunting cortisol way offsetting
medium term, long-term stress. supplement benefited from.
works GABA system systems, someone pointed study
admittedly done rats. point focusing mainly studies humans
episode, point study done rats showed
long-term administration ashwagandha actually create negative effects
mainly fibroid perhaps even cortisol system maybe melatonin system.
just wanna acknowledge study. reference caption rat
study. focused human studies. Please go examine.com. Put ashwagandha
will tell various effects different aspects brain body. will also link
pub med articles relevant called human effect matrix 'cause
focused humans. one reasons like examined.com
focused human studies, wonderful free resource, appreciate
pointed study want people aware range effects
various compounds can well. couple times previous episodes
said five HTP not five HT five HT serotonin five HTP precursor serotonin.
talking supplements compounds can stimulate release
serotonin. previous episode, actually referring context
don't personally like take five HTP. just bias reasons described
episode. heard say five HTP meant say five HT, apologize.
last, just wanna point something mentioned beginning

amount pain amount craving experience drug will increase
time. much pursuit pleasure simply reduce pain craving.
next time experienced something,

00:23:11 Desire Scales Pain: Yearning Function

really like don't wanna take experience really important
notice something really enjoy part enjoyment
anticipation wanting thing pain system action.
can distinguish dopamine really pleasure
dopamine really motivation pursue order relieve exclude
future pain. Let repeat that. Dopamine isn't much pleasure, much
motivation desire pursue order reduce amount pain
now talking pain psychological pain craving although people
miss lover badly really crave food badly, addicted
drug can't access, will experience physical craving mental
craving body brain linked way. almost, describe painful.
yearn it. think word yearning one valuable context,
yearning seems include whole body experience just wanting
just mind. desire something proportional
pleasureful indulge thing also much pain experience
don't it. can now start let mind wander sorts examples
addictions things happen like,

00:24:43 Croissant Craving Circuit

use example sometimes use love croissants.
Although several pointed called croissant sounds like
trying speak French always tried kid went
bilingual school failed gonna fail now. gonna call croissants.
delicious. love really good one makes wanna eat six. true.
pretty good impulse control, think makes wanna eat six. taste tastes
delicious unless really force experience taste mouth
flaky getting hungry right now delicious croissant mostly


tastes croissant makes want eat croissants. Now, eventually blood
sugar goes satiety reached, et cetera. happens then? satisfaction
satiety about? Well, separate neuromodulator.
neuromodulator serotonin. oxytocin. hormone system involves
something called prolactin. gonna talk book

00:25:45 “Here Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

"the Molecule More" wonderful book described now
molecules ones allow experience sensations pleasure
present brain stops projecting future. now talk
craving so-called now molecules engage kind
push pull balance will allow not just feel motivated, also enjoy
things life pursuing much greater degree. neurons
area brain called raphe R-A-P-H-E raphe releases serotonin different
places brain. Serotonin molecule bliss

00:26:26 Skin World

contentment already have. talked exteroception,
exteroception focus outside world, everything beyond confines
skin. also talked interoception focus things happening internally
within confines skin. Dopamine serotonin can thought related
extra reception. Dopamine makes us focused things outside us beyond
call personal space actually move take action order
achieve things serotonin general things
immediate now, hence description now molecules.
interesting point body brain can direct attention towards
things outside us inside us split attention those. talked
previous podcast didn't see it, no problem. Just understand dopamine
biases us toward thinking don't have,

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms
talked previous podcasts gives us sort balance pleasure seeking
offsetting pain pleasure now. pleasure really two things.
joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic

00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness



whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding

opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence

actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat

objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term

can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive

cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior

pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people

next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach

person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo

release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds

going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette

roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling

competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration

whereas serotonin related molecules like endocannabinoids
picked word cannabinoid, yes like cannabis cannabis attaches
endocannabinoids receptors endocannabinoids receptors
chemicals cannabinoids naturally make involved things like
forgetting. not coincidence pot smokers don't terrific memory.
may know great memories chances are, even
better memories weren't pot smokers make molecules bind
receptors make feel kinda blissed content present.
receptors exist us not sake consuming THC marijuana, sake
binding natural endogenous cannabinoids. got two systems
kind like push pull

00:28:15 Almond Meditation

say book wherever go Jon Kabat-Zinn
talks meditation practice. different meditation practices
eat one almond focus attention almond taste
almond, texture almond. really mindfulness practice geared
towards trying take behavior normally pursuit, normally feeding
going engage feeding dopamine pursue food
pleasure pain relationship talked focus one
almond becoming present behavior normally kind extra
susceptive pursuit behavior bring now mental trick
mental task mindfulness community really embraced order try
create increased pleasure already have. really trying accomplish
shift dopamine released serotonin cannabinoid system,
involved behavior. interested mindfulness something
talked podcast sort made off cuff jokes
opposite mindfulness mindlessness. Mindfulness vast space
mindful practice lot

00:29:30 Drugs Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

people engaged in. indeed can give deeper appreciation things


already have. Dopamine quality making people kind rabidly
pursuit things. Look people high cocaine amphetamine,
almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, opioids anything really hits
serotonin system hard tend make people rather lethargic content stay
exactly are. don't wanna pursue much all. Occasionally people
smoke marijuana consume THC appetite goes way really wanna
consume food. effects insulin effects blood sugar,
slightly separate matter. since you, probably minds might've
gone either experiences reports pot does, that.
got molecules like dopamine make focused things want
things crave. got molecules make content
have. important thing, perhaps creating healthy

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms

joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion

injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment

children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded

gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every

avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate

really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive

01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward

00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

emotional landscape balance two neuromodulator systems
people always anticipation desire seeking wonderful
pursuing goals. However, terrible enjoying life actually people
actually quite difficult around. certain, almost sociopathic element
people call hyper dopaminergic. People always
dopaminergic scale point always pursuing goals. fact,
people known least psychological spectrum. can
manipulative dopamine pursuit something doesn't necessarily high
energy intense outside. observe outside. fact,
people will manipulate order get want. shown
high levels dopamine release brain, learned kind
passive manipulation best way maneuver particular environment.
don't wanna focus much sociopathy kind extreme examples
just goes show people identify goal realize series steps
need take order achieve goal can either ethical means
non ethical means can active pursuit, kind type
person always declaring goals going it, posting Instagram
telling everybody it, try recruit others. phenotype kind
signature dopamine people wanna get want,


always serving people always taking care everybody
else's needs always trying accomplish goals mode least
outside seems passive supporting others. Neither
good bad. dopamine molecule. doesn't care
reach goals. cares reach goals internal sensation
one mild pleasure little bit pain, although pain time.

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.

dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people

next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people

joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo

release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling

people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent

aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward

00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine,
Prescription Drugs

not reaching goals takes away now.
point podcast guessing thinking, okay, great.
want dopamine. want motivated. don't wanna procrastinate much
want able experience life. want now molecules
released well. Well, way that, understand source
procrastination not one thing. basically two kinds procrastinators
says research. first kind people actually really enjoy stress
impending deadline. way can get action. people
really like feeling something due hour activated sharp
focused makes feel. people people tapping
epinephrin system, stress system stress really tightens ability
see creates soda straw view world. creates action element
body makes feel like wanna move. really eliminates distractions
them. actually leveraging stress internal stress order achieve state
can't seem otherwise achieve. won't tell order
overcome kinds procrastination logical perspective, makes sense
therefore, kinds people think ways can get
system activation, talked previous podcasts couple
tools might called super oxygenation breathing admit not
always super oxygenating. didn't want consume anything.
25 30 cycles deep inhales exhales. likely create anxiety
low level stress. someone prone panic attacks wouldn't
recommend this, pretty straight forward. will deploy adrenaline system.
will find visual field focused will able work focus


better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

00:37:04 Enough Never Enough; Dopamine Undermines

high, creates sense pleasure desire more, can also


become person enough never enough. thing dopamine really
wants thing releases dopamine big inflections dopamine,
whether not come cocaine whether not come
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make want
something heard growth mindset incredible discovery
colleague, Carol Dweck positive mindsets psychology
community put forth really good pursuit goals pursuit things
require long bouts effort. Well, wonderful can learn attach dopamine
process psychologically, starting augment amount dopamine
increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.
orgasm, regardless chromosomal background dramatic decrease
dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned
dopamine reward circuitry relationship dopamine
prolactin. started leverage this, believe not. major event take
couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral
neuropathy, people thought reasonably safe again, always
check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness

children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded

gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every

avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate

really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive

competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy

better just kinda waited around wave motivation wash
you. Normally waiting deadline come sight
stimulus is. can self-direct adrenaline release without ingesting anything.
can also ingest coffee, caffeine Mate something like that, prefer
often coffee, caffeine. Caffeine release dopamine low levels
much releases dopamine isn't clear. seems increase firing neurons
nucleus accumbens 30% pretty low level, can create
agitation caffeine sensitive people, problem. talked
things like L tyrosine precursor dopamine Mucuna Purina. talked
last episode didn't see that, just remind L tyrosine present
red meats, certain nuts L tyrosine precursor dopamine. can
supplement L tyrosine. like, will get big inflection dopamine
crash associated it. However, will increase motivation short term not
suggesting anyone this. wanna clear say always say. not
doctor. don't prescribe anything. professor. profess things. know
whether not things appropriate mental physical health not.
need consult doctor. instance, people suffer schizotypal
schizophrenia mania probably not taking supplements increase
dopamine levels. Now, can't increase level focus level
alertness level motivation using breathing well might
something else play. procrastinators simply not
releasing enough dopamine. not making enough dopamine.
people variety things can increase dopamine. suggest talk
psychiatrist doctor talked Mucuna Purina, 99.9%. L-DOPA
precursor dopamine. people much better take things
increase dopamine levels. antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior
increase name increased dopamine epinephrin,
can increase risk epileptic attacks epileptic. again, talk
doctor will increase dopamine motivation focus. However, think
back earlier discussion dopamine, dopamine

increase amount dopamine things like supplementation prescription
drugs gonna happen not gonna need pursue
sorts things associated dopamine. studying,
sport pursuit, higher mountains, money, whatever know
time, mirror image pain lack accomplishment will also
increase. pleasure pain relationship talked earlier.
moments, gonna talk think healthy dopamine schedules just
wanna take step back second talk little bit flip side Dolby
happens so-called dopamine crash mechanisms installed us,
believe not, mechanisms installed us really
put complete total break dopamine,
experienced actually ways can
navigate them. dopamine crashes intentional dopamine suppression
mechanisms order leverage healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

feel motivated. Perhaps one fundamental mechanisms
humans neuro circuitry designed seeking mates reproduction
continuation one species primary driver species.
just reality. Now removing context here. whatever say, course,
backdrop consensual age appropriate species, appropriate context,
appropriate that. not sociology reproduction sex.
biology, biology sex males females doesn't matter XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. reality


dopamine released anticipation consummation sex reproduction.

dopamine increase hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin associated
milk let-down lactating mothers. also present males general prolactin
creates sense lethargy stillness lack desire move lack desire
pursue whatever released dopamine. Prolactin fact, sets refractory
period male's ability mate

00:40:30 Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression Prolactin

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen
different hens." turns different hens. reason introduction
novel mate increases dopamine levels. interesting
copulation prolactin goes roof prevents copulation dopamine
crashes introduction sort novelty shortens this. Now not ploy
people change mates often story dopamine prolactin
system also exists humans. Now, actually things people certain
communities take order bypass refractory periods. actually drugs
increase dopamine

00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look
literature either wellness cost sports performance community
lot so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters actually combinations
vitamin B6 zinc inhibit prolactin way inhibiting prolactin increase
dopamine. functional effect regard. not really
increasing testosterone directly suppressing prolactin levels.
clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia leads massive decreases libido, et
cetera. prescription drugs treat hyperprolactinemia, course
always talk endocrinologist sorts prescription drugs.
interesting basic mechanism dopamine prolactin, sort
motivation, no motivation system evolved

00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity Side Effects Anti-Dopaminergic
Drugs

reproduction first, actually takes place. can see elsewhere
world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking
high dysregulated dopamine circuits brain. One treatments
schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days
schizophrenia, taking meds, who, aren't
ever see somebody street like lip smacking writhing
actually called tardive dyskinesia. movement disorder created
taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue
elevated levels prolactin suppressing
dopamine much. Now really extreme case, maybe perhaps see
somebody engaging strange kind face riding body riding behaviors


actually not consequence mental illness. consequence
often drugs

00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending Arc Dopamine

taking treat mental illness. side effects drugs. Now
prolactin increased time. really heightened, intense experience.
not just released sex reproduction. Prolactin released major
event, actually responsible thought postpartum depression different
types kind the, let low. can distinctly remember finals
publishing big paper, very, happy find that, Oh,
know like next things might seem little bit dimmed dulled next day
so, following week. timescales gonna vary
people release lot dopamine long time response something great
people quick inflection dopamine back feeling not
great. really varies person person. fact, long ago, started learned

couple 100 milligrams vitamin B6. think people diabetic neuropathy
need careful vitamin B6 check doctor. told, although
haven't found literature can, cases exacerbate peripheral

check physician take B6 kind offset low.
actually, don't know subjective not seemed somewhat
positive effect. also started just internalizing fact dopamine subjective.
objective aspects dopamine much released also
subjective effects dopamine. one things can order
generally just happier person especially person pursuit long-term
goals kind longer can extend positive phase dopamine
release. can blunt pain response better,
can actually cognitively. used joke lab publish paper
get really excited, wouldn't allow get excited wanted
instead still tried try extend arc positive
experience long possibly can simply thinking back like, Oh, really


cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior

joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact

suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling

people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified

really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent

aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward

one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology

rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen

now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging

giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report

Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every

craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing

celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms

yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not

01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

now gonna vary tremendously individual individual. also can,
data showing can vary tremendously mate pairing mate pairing number
one thing releases dopamine novelty true refractory period
shortened introduction novel mates. first shown kind classic
experiment things chickens. called Coolidge effect story
story goes believe true story, actually neuroendocrinology
textbooks. believe true president Calvin Coolidge visiting chicken
farm. taken around person hosting visit showed
rooster Coolidge wife visit said "this rooster
copulates thousands times per day." Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind elbowed
president Coolidge said, "ah, hear that" kind like pointing prowess
rooster Coolidge said," yeah let ask question, hen

suppress prolactin vice versa. actually another way suppress prolactin.


Vitamin B6 fairly potent prolactin inhibitor zinc. look

world, instance schizophrenia disease many different types facets,
schizophrenia case often hyperactivation dopamine system much
can make people feel kind high, hallucinate, mean, talking

schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors.
unfortunate, many people street days

taking anti dopaminergic drugs. can imagine anti-doping synergic
drugs effective suppressing hallucinations create
movement problems dopamines importance movement circuitry so-
called pyramidal circuitry aficionados. addition, sometimes see males
take drugs, drugs like haloperidol dopamine blockers
actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. development male breast tissue

cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior

joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility

even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting

long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

cool. really enjoy work. really enjoyed discovery. really enjoy
people working time, pleasure was. can
get easily pictures people, things like Costello really enjoy trips
taken. can extend pleasure without engage behavior
over. extending arc dopamine release well. offset
pain not experience occur again.

00:48:00 Chemistry “I Won, Now What?”

Now high performers probably familiar many people
big achievement. first thoughts will now, gonna
next? ever gonna exceed that? indeed many people high
kind dopamine sensation novelty seeking scale prone addiction.
prone rabid pursuit external goals external perception neglect
internal mechanisms allow feel calm happy. people
driven, motivated adopting practice able engage
now sort almond type practices talked earlier learning
achieve really good night's sleep regular basis tools mechanisms
talked previous podcasts gives us sort balance pleasure seeking
offsetting pain pleasure now. pleasure really two things.
joy pursuit also joy have.

00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child Parent

beautiful model emotional development developed Alan
shore professor UCLA psychiatrist talks basics good
infant parent attachment good parenting leads healthy adult relationships
emotion regulation tends include sides dopamine serotonin spectrum.
talk relationship child parent typically mother,
also father can get child really excited kind squealing ramping
talking something ice cream play. kid gets excited.
dopaminergic system anticipation something coming, well
engaging children way really everything right
now, reading book kids always seem ask one time. One


more. seem want things enjoy really engaging
way increases sense pleasure right there, well
giving lot

00:50:03 Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

things excited positive anticipation. Now, worked years ago
at-risk kids also young kids summer camps things like one
things learn never say maybe kid reward. say,
might ice cream later essentially saying ice cream.
don't hear maybe part turns adults don't either. really interesting.
something called reward prediction error. talked
haven't really talked deeply context dopamine system, dopamine,
said, involved anticipation wanting, not involved motivation
toward thing want. biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error
equals actual amount dopamine released response something versus
minus amount expected. Okay. tell kid, might ice cream
hear gonna ice cream expect it. later say, well
not gonna ice cream said, maybe actually gonna lead much bigger
crash dopamine. going lead negative signal, punishment signal.
literally going feel like pain. kids, can leverage this. parents say maybe
effectively telling dopamine system absolutely. Now adults like too.
think something might happen doesn't happen big crash
aspect, emotionality dopamine system goes firing
three four times per second 10 15 times per second possibility
something might happen possibility deeply woven biology
dopamine motivation system, way us presumably ancient times explore
novel territories get sense maybe water there. Maybe mates
there. Maybe better food maybe resources there. maybe
important thing language terms maybe means maybe,

00:52:02 Surprise!

neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps going surprise


even bigger dopamine reward. one thing dopamine loves anything
else surprise. get something positive, go mailbox expecting
bills open get letter somebody haven't thought
long time. adore person. huge dopamine release.
actually triggers neuroplasticity. probably never forget way
dopamine Gates' plasticity. get an, surprise something didn't want,
also creates plasticity. surprise, novelty, motivation, reward
woven package call dopamine. cool thing can actually
regulate whole system way will steer lean towards positive
anticipation things life less disappointment. simply matter

00:52:59 Suppressing Drive Motivation Working Late?

adjusting call dopamine schedule. Okay. couple things
continue, gonna talk attention deficit minutes. that,
wanna talk something mentioned previous podcasts,
may not aware aware may still doing, severely
injuring ability release dopamine creating sense disappointment ways
likely hurting mentally physically. blunting
dopamine viewing light middle night realized not discussion
sleep circadian rhythms, data now strong showing viewing
bright light 10:00 PM 4:00 often triggers activation circuit
called habenula eye goes retina structure called
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A habenula reward circuitry
suppresses activation reward. Circuitry, not just moment, things
normally positively anticipate pursue. reason bring now
haven't really gone depth dopamine system now,
understand precious reward system. kind double-
edged sword. needs taken care treated well. wanna use it, not
overuse it, et cetera getting bright light exposure middle night
reducing capacity release dopamine. not just sleep
not getting time. also not getting dopamine
otherwise available you. actually taking, think light middle
night kind antagonist kind blocker dopamine. Maybe that'll help you.


somebody work middle night wanna bypass
dopamine suppression please see episode jet lag shift work

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every
gives wind keep playing. the, probability winning
craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing
invest time energy order achieve goals rewards may
reach. never really know going succeed. make crystal clear,
celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn



01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling

people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified

great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive

hopefully giving money away. already enough something

encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good

reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms

yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not

01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn



01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

01:21:25 Corrections & Notes Spanish Captions & Languages Soon

achievements powerful way ensure will stay path
pursuit. point podcast like take moment address
corrections. made errors previous episodes. weren't major errors
couple pointed important strive accuracy.
first one talked previous episode potential benefits
people, not ashwagandha role blunting cortisol way offsetting
medium term, long-term stress. supplement benefited from.
works GABA system systems, someone pointed study
admittedly done rats. point focusing mainly studies humans
episode, point study done rats showed
long-term administration ashwagandha actually create negative effects
mainly fibroid perhaps even cortisol system maybe melatonin system.
just wanna acknowledge study. reference caption rat
study. focused human studies. Please go examine.com. Put ashwagandha
will tell various effects different aspects brain body. will also link
pub med articles relevant called human effect matrix 'cause
focused humans. one reasons like examined.com
focused human studies, wonderful free resource, appreciate
pointed study want people aware range effects
various compounds can well. couple times previous episodes
said five HTP not five HT five HT serotonin five HTP precursor serotonin.
talking supplements compounds can stimulate release
serotonin. previous episode, actually referring context
don't personally like take five HTP. just bias reasons described
episode. heard say five HTP meant say five HT, apologize.
last, just wanna point something mentioned beginning
Huberman Lab Podcast now subtitled Spanish episodes one


two well welcome video Spanish. ones will subtitled soon.

Spanish dubbing audio platforms. realized again, covered
lot material. Hopefully now know far dopamine system reward
motivation beginning podcast. Hopefully also
understand side dopamine reward, pain balance
pleasure pain system, well molecules call described
molecule book, say now molecules things like serotonin
endocannabinoids. talked variety supplement based tools, things
like vitamin B6 zinc relate prolactin P-E-A interesting compound
never tried interesting definitely use L-DOPA MuCuna
appearings talked caffeine, talked nicotine. Talk
effects Adderall can created purely cognitively without actually ingesting Adderall,
simply telling people ingesting Adderall giving caffeine. interesting
study referenced little bit earlier, talked scheduling dopamine
adopting intermittent reward schedule order ensure long-term
engagement pursuits hope healthy pursuits ones serve well
no means exhaustive coverage things, dopamine motivation.
no means. time gonna talk dopamine motivation,
next episode gonna continue talk emotions yet another perspective
hopefully enough now think meantime, can
consider adopting life practices always. really wanna thank
time attention. learned something useful today, please pass along. One
things teach science think really wonderful adopt general
life idea watch one, one, teach one. tell graduate students
med students post-docs watch somebody something, learn it,
apply it, see works teach it. usually not watch one, one,

00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

lot tips will allow order understand
control dopamine system leverage better life. need
understand results important experiment. experiment able
separate pleasure motivation. simple, like many simple experiments
elegant experiment, now done animals.
humans, offered rats food. food particularly liked animals
lever press pellet food kind classic experiment eat food
presumably liked food motivated, press lever eat it.
Great. took rats. eliminated dopamine neurons. can
injection neurotoxin destroys neurons. actually no dopamine
brain. no ability release dopamine gave lever
rats sit hit lever eat food. still enjoyed
food. say, well, okay dopamine involved motivation. involved
pleasure. No, absolutely is. still enjoy food, moved rat
literally one body length away lever. found animals
dopamine move lever, press eat. ones, rats
not dopamine available them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
lever order press get food. Dopamine, therefore not
ability experience pleasure, motivation pleasure. repeated
humans variety different scenarios. can't really lever press thing
quite easily know people low levels dopamine simply less
motivated even though can achieve pleasure. serious ramifications
fact now, quote unquote pleasure ways induce things believe give
us pleasure everywhere. within reach. don't forage
food. lot highly processed, high sugar high fat foods. also foods
healthy, tastes good hopefully pretty easy get
different people different access things, course, dopamine isn't
ability experience pleasure. motivated reach
pleasures. many probably thinking, wow not motivated


person. Like talked one kind procrastination earlier.
just feel kind met life now you, may real clinical
depression talk professional. good prescription drugs
can really help people. also great non drug treatments psychotherapy
treatments developed addition psychotherapy various
kinds psychoanalysis, et cetera, one can use. think data really points
fact combination pharmacology talk therapies generally best.
huge range things.

00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

know many professions. not gonna talk right now.
compound. kind interesting supplement space isn't
MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA not L tyrosine isn't promoting massive releases
dopamine even dopamine alone combination dopamine serotonin.
intriguing molecule sold counter. Again, check
healthcare provider take anything remove anything.
important, is, it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel aiming, P-E-A pea beta fenal
Ethel aiming releases dopamine low levels also serotonin low level.
kind cocktail motivation molecules well quote unquote now
molecules. people's response varies widely many people report feeling
heightened sense mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera. bit stimulant like
anything triggers activation dopamine norepinephrine pathway
interesting supplement. actually haven't tried before. can't report
experiences. will point however, examine.com. wouldn't Huberman Lab
Podcast episode. didn't point examine.com incredible free resource
can put supplement. will tell quote unquote human effect matrix
it'll point various studies. always provide link caption.
amazing resource. can go explore haven't talked beta
Fino, L Ethel, Amy previous podcasts wanted add list
things tap dopamine system this. guess call now
supplementation space. personally fascinated supplements things
exist



01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact
impulsivity age 10 actually predictive overeating disorders later stage
life. drugs designed create heightened activity
braking system decelerator reward pathway designed reduce impulsivity
suppress release dopamine allow, hopefully allow
children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching
milestone achieving craving not. Now won't work extreme cases
drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can
subjective system. fact, gonna describe experiment
highlights just powerful subjective readout subjective interpretation

01:05:22 Subjective Control Dopamine Drug Effects: “Adderall” Experiment



given experience really can be. Even level pharmacology. love examples
subjective effects things otherwise seem hardwired
really illustrate interplay cognition, belief system
otherwise these, just plug chug kind mechanisms of, eat X amount
chocolate drink X amount water water deprived certain amount
time. get X amount dopamine. experiment. experiment
just published March 18, 2021. recently, title experiment
expectation stimulant type modifies caffeine effects mood cognition
done college students. fascinating study. gave
college students either placebo essentially nothing 200 milligrams caffeine. 200
milligrams caffeine well, typical coffee like medium coffee
buy drip coffee coffee make home. fair amount caffeine.
take pill form definitely make feel alert unless
one mutants literally mutants insensitive caffeine.
mutants pretty rare. took 65 undergraduate students college.
randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
ones expected Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects. felt
much high. performed better working memory test. general,
increased cognitive effects seen Adderall
ingesting caffeine. shows interaction drug caffeine
expectation Adderall. led heightened performance simply
students thought getting Adderall. don't know whether
not told end wasn't Adderall. doubt this.
wanna look study published journal experimental clinical


psychopharmacology. paper Looby L-O-O-B-Y all. again, just
published March 18th, 2021 speaks fact yes, so-called placebo
effects different placebo. belief effect specific
reactions given stimulant be. think important
think points fact top kind higher level cognitive
processes impacting even basic fundamental aspects say dopamine
release mountain adrenaline release epinephrin release ways can
positively impact performance. case, positive improvement working
memory focus.

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every
gives wind keep playing. the, probability winning
craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing
invest time energy order achieve goals rewards may
reach. never really know going succeed. make crystal clear,
celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn

01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills

long talking caffeine like point study. really
interesting. published journal neuroscience society
neurosciences kind flagship journal. journal. good journal
showed caffeine can increase dopamine release brain 30%.
wasn't surprising. even said earlier, also showed
protective effect dopamine neurons. caffeine cases may not just increase
dopamine release might actually protective effect dopamine neurons.
Now distinctly different claims drugs like MDMA ecstasy
argued can, neurotoxic things like dopamine serotonin neurons.
study published journal science, extremely
prestigious excellent journal later, shown wasn't MDMA ecstasy
given case. actually amphetamine, known destroy dopaminergic
serotonergic neurons. mean? means low levels
caffeine may least studies protective dopamine neurons time
MDMA ecstasy something clinical trials right now treatment trauma
PTSD various kinds depression still illegal point time may although
doesn't appear yet published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps
origin, urgent neuron. real asterix question mark
amphetamine particular methamphetamine destructive dopaminergic
neurons. don't think us needed additional reasons avoid
methamphetamine. drug creates huge increases dopamine huge
crashes dopamine, destructive drug.



01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

addition seems destroy dopaminergic neurons time time,
talked nicotine here, not smoking obviously smoking bad lung
cancer's bad health, et cetera, nicotine supplemental form mentioned
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose lot Nicorette.
know people Nicorette believe neuroprotective effects
Parkinson's Alzheimer's indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
talked earlier whether not protective effect isn't clear protective
effects might noradrenergic acetylcholine systems. findings
still unclear interesting note nicotine can increase prolactin.
Somewhat. couple studies happy link caption
shows nicotine taken much

01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad
Good)

long periods time can also increase prolactin opposite side
dopamine. today talked lot dopamine system kinds
schedules will allow craving addiction, schedule dopamine.
going allow maximize pursuit pleasure elimination
pain. get answer good friend gambling, reason gambling
works reason people will throw lives away. reason people go back
places like Las Vegas Atlantic city
hope anticipation cities places built dopamine,
leveraging dopamine system. realized experienced gamblers.
people enjoy gambling. actually just say, like sitting roulette
table. take designated amount money. not much, enjoy playing little bit
roulette. certainly enjoy win. certainly don't like lose
cheerly pleasure playing. seldom. don't gambling
problem. did, probably tell don't gambling problem. Yet
people throw away entire lives gambling. friend mine certified
addiction treatment specialist tells gambling addiction particularly sinister


next time really thing changes everything. Unlike
addictions next time really change everything. embedded
mind gambling addict rarely work favor wellbeing
gambling addict family. However, intermittent reinforcement schedule
discovered long ago scientific researchers. slot machine every
gives wind keep playing. the, probability winning
craps table roulette table, blackjack just often enough willing
buy tickets, head play again, go downstairs room even
though swore done night intermittent reinforcement
powerful form dopamine reward schedule keep something can
export that. can use good. something pursuing life
whether not academic goal financial goal, relationship goal. One
things can ensure

01:14:14 Intermittent Halting Celebration; Enjoy Wins, Not

will remain path goal long time, will
continue exceed previous performance well continue enjoy
dopamine release occurs hit milestones want achieve
occasionally remove reward subjectively, say set goal making
gonna make quantitative respect finances 'cause just easy description
also sport. school. music
anything creative endeavors say set certain financial goal say
wanna get certain number followers whatever social media platform
reach one goals. know now amount dopamine
not going peak. actually going diminish make crave key
avoiding crash still keep healthy levels will allow continue.
pursuit are, stair casing toward goal. Maybe dollars, maybe
followers maybe grades maybe metric metals
trophies. actually want blunt reward response intermediate
goals. Now not telling celebrate wins telling not
celebrate them. Whereas good friend mine recently fortunately
great financial success. asked somebody else good friend mine.
tuned dopamine reward schedules understands work


really deep level. said," don't know next." said," Oh, well,
simple, just give away." wasn't ploy receive
money ourselves. really reducing impact reward. Now
hopefully giving money away. already enough something
rewarding itself. student pursuing goals
university athlete, pursuing goals actually makes sense
rational perspective. understand mechanisms hit new high point
performance, get A-plus A-minus, et cetera tell
yourself, okay, good. actually actively blunt reward not go
celebrate intensely, keep dopamine system check
ensure gonna stay path continued pursuit not just
thing, things big increases dopamine leads big crashes dopamine
big increases dopamine ante. increase extent willing
invest time energy order achieve goals rewards may
reach. never really know going succeed. make crystal clear,
celebrate wins don't celebrate every win. one way can ensure
going continue path progress. think learning
tools schools reward genuine performance.
encouraging us. believe can perform well. One hallmarks
growth mindset internalization not getting right yet. word yet
important. also sense reward good behavior, good
performance, not every time. One way actually take reward
reinforcement hands mind. tell somebody
control whether not allowed feel good wins. Now,
realize unnatural people somebody simply going
pursuit going really register wins, think gonna
actually make better performer will short term, not longterm.
can lift Las Vegas Atlantic city gambling mechanisms
places known long time. lifted scientists. can now take
back can start leverage that. just make intermittent. reward
yourself, not predictable schedule not every time every third time
every 10th time, sometimes three row not 10 days. reward
important. Self reward critically important make sure not
predictable schedule burn



01:18:38 Story Example Intermittent Reward Maintain Long-Term Drive
Motivation

dopamine circuits undercut ability strive achieve.
Actually story graduate school forced intermittent
reinforcement schedule believe served well scientific career
aspects life. graduate advisor amazing scientist. Unfortunately,
passed away amazing scientists amazing human dry
somewhat cruel sense humor. name Barbara Chapman, published
paper journal, science science nature cell considered big three
competitive journals publish in. first author paper science.
really exciting me. graduate student. excited
discovery. excited science. just thrilled. remember
paper finally got accepted involved ton revisions lot
hard work. came said," paper got accepted." super excited
just kind sat nodded, said "are gonna celebrate, gonna
party?" what, like, gonna it? never forget answer.
said," think skip one." thought joking. said,"
mean skip one?" gonna publish paper. said, yeah,
gonna publish paper. said, " maybe get like four maybe
three, maybe two too." thought messing wasn't messing
me. right. never party. celebration paper.
think really trying instill two ideas me. One work
supposed rewarding. practice experimentation writing
paper, experience achieving something worked hard
indeed feel amazing. actually can still feel body. Now, excitement.
a, still dopamine release arc going long. almost 20
years ago now happened. remarkable. one
right. never went celebrated celebrate wins papers
future things sort. either consciously subconsciously
putting intermittent reward schedule. day something really
good happens actually hesitate whether not wanna internalize
celebrate whether wanna tell anybody form celebration


getting positive feedback. cautious deploy
dopamine release response wins. certainly not way navigated
career. number principles incorporate intermittent reward
wins

simply telling people ingesting Adderall giving caffeine. interesting
study referenced little bit earlier, talked scheduling dopamine
adopting intermittent reward schedule order ensure long-term
engagement pursuits hope healthy pursuits ones serve well
no means exhaustive coverage things, dopamine motivation.
no means. time gonna talk dopamine motivation,
next episode gonna continue talk emotions yet another perspective

01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

non-prescription seem to, least people positive effects.
instance, last episode talked CDOT L-carnitine, several papers
report antidepressant effects well positive effects things, sperm
health, ovarian health, et cetera. learned colleague acetyl L-carnitine
Europe actually prescription drug US sold counter. guess,
depending listening availability might vary. always,
put caveat, check healthcare provider, right
fascinated fact things exist lie somewhere
prescription drugs nothing. makes interesting compounds.
think P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine yet another one the, compounds.
going talk lot attention deficit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
future episode, wanna mention today context dopamine
impulsivity. ADHD ADD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD clinical
diagnoses. think lot people nowadays walk around say ADD
ADD indeed one can create sort ADD attention switching time.
big fan Cal Newport. wrote book" deep work." believe one
said context switching terrible brain. like worst thing brain
brain learns context, switch real deep work productivity,
learning kinds good relationships kinds really come depth experience
not breadth experience within moment. think important know
clinical ADHD ADD kind people kind
inducing distraction social media phones, et cetera. can
sometimes lead clinical ADHD ADD wanna talk ADHD ADD
kids just briefly drugs normally given treat conditions ADHD
ADD things like Adderall things amphetamine, light qualities
structures, might ask, that? Well, turns kids
activate brain circuitry break exists deeper mesolimbic
circuitry. recall, VTA nucleus accumbens kind
accelerators dopamine. prefrontal cortex acts break
can limit impulsivity. drugs tend increase activity neurons
pathway, prefrontal cortex reduces impulsivity. fact, experiment
described book "the molecule more," really interesting


looked impulsivity obese children turns experiment safe
way looked kids obese kids non obese kids willingness
cross busy highway. turns obese kids got hit cars often
non obese children. turns virtual reality experiment
nothing fact obese limitations movement speed
movement. obese children impulsive variety contexts
not just virtual crossing street thing. turns data point fact

children

01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

become adults better control schedule dopamine release.
now talk dopamine schedule can leverage order
heightened levels motivation not get much dopamine
experiencing crash afterwards. also, can experience heightened
pleasure various pursuits engaged life. know many
interested tools will allow motivated focus longer, sleep better.
really Huberman Lab Podcast always framed
context neuro-biological principles objective mechanisms. tools
can apply dopamine system motivation can really improve
ability stay pursuit things, well enjoy things achieved goals,
even route, goals. key principle. Dopamine subjective.
Meaning can either allow experience pleasure reaching

drugs like cocaine amphetamine, actually pretty powerful one can

randomized either placebo caffeine told either
getting caffeine Adderall. Now, Adderall cognitively carries different
expectation. College students know Adderall much stronger stimulant
caffeine. know create sort high. way students described
thought increase level focus ability perform
work. really interesting definitely effect placebo versus
caffeine. not surprising, however, right, take placebo may may not
feel alert take 200 milligrams caffeine likely gonna feel
alert also effect whether not students thought
getting caffeine Adderall. subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
stimulated, anxious, motivated subjects received placebo. Okay.
