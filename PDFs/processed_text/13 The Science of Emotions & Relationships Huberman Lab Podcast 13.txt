everyone's perception emotion slightly different. Meaning, idea happy
likely different idea state happiness is. know also
color vision, instance, even though cells eye eye perceive
color red identical right genes express, can certain
based experimental evidence, called psychophysical studies,
idea intense red going different idea
intense red given selection 10 different reds asked one
intense, one looks red, seems crazy, think
something simple color universal, yet not. need

00:10:53 Understand Emotions: Look Infancy & Puberty

today's going interactive way previous podcast episodes not.
want understand emotions, look emotions first develop.
fact, critical central theme want understand brain science
psychology. rule neuroanatomy. look 50 different brains
humans compare brains dogs humans, lot differences.
Certain things certain things different. rule every good
neuroanatomist knows want understand part brain does,
address two questions. First, know connections
brain area make? connected to? get inputs
send inputs? instance, area brain gets direct input
neurons nose, can pretty certain role analyzing
smell measuring something odors analyzing something odors. Now
also gets input eye, can also conclude gets input visual
system cares light photons. sort obvious. yet need


know connectivity, need know called developmental origin
structure. need know early development, things
move around lot brain develops. brain, course less
squishy thing floating around liquid stuffed inside skull.
consequence, things move around lot. not always place two
different species two individuals species. know
started out, started informs well.
talking emotions, cannot point one area brain. can't say
area brain responsible emotions. so-called limbic
system linked emotions various ways. going talk
today. limbic system just one component inputs create emotions.
not place emotions. can't go lesion one location brain
eliminate emotions entirely, just doesn't work way. So, first all, ask,
circuits emotion? brain areas emotion? nowadays
lot debate this. years, thought might circuits,
meaning connections brain generate feeling happy circuits
generate feeling sad, et cetera. challenged. fact, Lisa
Feldman Barrett person really challenged head-on,
good evidence fact circuits probably don't exist. yet think
good evidence circuits brain, limbic circuits circuits shift
overall states overall level alertness calmness, whether not,
bias us toward viewing outside world paying attention going
inside bodies. none makes sense right now, promise will make sense
soon. important thing understand emotions arise brain
body. arise specific connections specific areas
brain body. want understand emotions work, look
emotions built. built infancy, adolescence, puberty,
continues adulthood. groundwork laid early development
small children. think happens baby comes
world. baby comes world. born world without really
understanding things around you. Now, two ways can interact
world always less degree
time. interoception, paying attention going inside you, feel
internally, exteroception, paying attention going outside you. Hold


mind, please. fact interocepting exterocepting true
entire life, sets foundation understanding emotions. absolutely
critical. infant, didn't knowledge needed. didn't
understand hunger, didn't understand toys first came world,

00:15:21 First Feeling Anxiety

didn't understand cold heat that. needed something,
experienced anxiety. feel increase alertness use
bathroom. feel increase alertness hungry,
vocalize, cry out, act agitated. might cue, might
number different things, knew feeling internally.
caregiver, whoever might've respond that.
feel agitation, caregiver come make decision, Oh, need food,
give milk, change diaper wrap blanket cold,
didn't know cold, just assume cold.
actually really important understand baby, baby,
baby, didn't sense outside world except responded
acts anxiety essentially. Now isn't Freudian theory, components
embedded Freudian theory, developmental psychologists agree
babies lack ability make cognitive sense outside world, feeling
anxiety registering one's internal state, crying outside world,
either crying subtle vocalizations, even just cuing, making noise,
start develop relationship outside world internal states,
shifts anxiety start drive requests, people come respond
requests, hopefully. reason say hopefully heard presumably
cases neglect. lot cases neglect baby,
neglect adolescent teenager, development doesn't go well, touch
those. really extreme cases. sort like parallel
experiments often done laboratory animals, probably
heard enriched environments give mice bunch toys,
give different foods every while, house together
mice. find animals, will say, "Oh, brain
thicker neurons branches that." really


comparing deprivation normalcy.

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't
know, can guess, don't know. fact, time don't even know
feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things
reliable, people reliable, able give interoception.
literally trust interoceptive needs internal needs will met

PTSD. roots talking now. important
internalize understand talking now order get

us mostly interoceptive. Whereas feeling extremely happy,
true. Something great happens world, just going feel it.

tethered outside world degree another. true
infant, true adolescent, true adult. now
want just pause, just shelve discussion interoception, exteroception
moment.

00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions Deliberate Overdrive

want talk arguably second most, not, equally important
aspect development relates emotionality relates this,
call trust, ability predict whether not things outside world reliable
not reliable terms ability help meet interoceptive needs.
period puberty. now, talking mainly psychology, not lot
biology, not lot mechanism. now going transition talking
mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty absolute biological event.


beginning, specific definition, transition reproductive
maturity. lot hormonal changes. Yes, also lot brain
changes. people don't realize it, brain changes occur first. brain
turns hormone systems

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not
just reproductively competent, course, shift

premier journals field science biology adolescence puberty,
well core needs demands met successful
emotional maturation time. will provide link that, just want
highlight things place final table. don't want go
results right now, like. mainly
highlight lot changes neurons neural circuits. instance, just
highlight one, connection dopamine centers brain
area brain involved emotion dispersal. Dispersal interesting.
observe animals humans around end adolescence
transition puberty, changes brain changes
hormones intense desire part child get
away primary caregivers, not permanently, always return, similar child


walks off looks back sees everything's safe continues on.
adolescence puberty, animals kids, almost seems like
bias action, action always direction away primary caregiver.
Now, soon say that, can just imagine mind somebody
saying, "Well, no, kid soon hit puberty, just want stay home us
time." not typical. happens, not typical. Mostly desire
start spending time friends, time peers less time adults.
find extremely interesting note not just true humans, true
primate species. true rodents. true almost every
mammalian species. something hormones don't just allow
sexual reproduction. don't just change brain bodily organs shape
us, also bias us towards dispersal, getting away primary
caregivers particular. parents teenagers future teenagers, not just normal,
baked biology humans disperse around adolescents teen
years. again, just want highlight these, listed intervention
strategies promote healthy adolescence puberty. interesting
entire article, mention wrote article, apologies. One friend
mine. first author Ronald Dahl, not children's book author, assuming,
no, School Public Health University California, Berkeley Nicholas
Allen, Linda Wilbert Anna Balanoff Suliman, forgive pronunciation

people will interested translates real world.
interesting puberty, increased connection, connectivity call

interactions world. Oftentimes engaging unsafe behavior.
never try justify underlying neurology, neuroscience points
increased connectivity areas brain related emotionality


threat detection like amygdala, also reward. time testing behaviorally
different behaviors lead success not. different behaviors lead fear
states not. Now, course say stage development,
seems like puberty very, heightened stage testing contingencies,
good bad taking place. course operating body now
capable infant. infant can damage error,
harder damage deliberate planning.
important course, lock medications house, make sure infants can't
get them, not likely infant going devise extremely diabolical

can start map neurology onto emotional exploration. realize
episode emotions. Puberty time internal state
person animal sampled tested different exteroceptive events,
now able guide events urgency. no longer just
whether not caregiver bringing milk bringing food. Now, course,
parents will say, "Yeah, paying everything doing. paying
car paying food." Ah, true. biology doesn't care
source, child adolescent now able, teen really, able now sample
many, many exteroceptive events behavior.
recommendations interesting. theory one motivations learn
mitigate risk famine malnutrition. teenagers get older, start
questioning whether not parents everything thought were, whether
not greatest thing ever worst thing ever was, perhaps.
Including whether not will able provide resources. test
whether not can actually feed themselves, whether not can support
themselves. Although rarely not, certainly happens, rarely really taking
care themselves. Although teens forced take care
course, parents caretakers aren't available.

LILting falling language. good example Italian. don't speak
Italian. know little bit Italian, Italian know
Italian colleagues said me, [speaks foreign language], means like

saying don't speak Italian, true. one knows loves
Costello much, always say [speaks foreign language], means big, lazy
guy, accurately captures Costello. even examples, [speaks

varies language. One reasons find Italian beautiful, not Italian
speak, Italian people speak beautiful listen prosody
shifts intonation really quite remarkable. almost like singing song
listening speak. used like go scientific meetings. always hang
Italians, 'cause good friends Italian labs, also 'cause

really careful work

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via Body

going talk month hormones. talking
neuroscience emotions, talk vagus nerve. described
vagus nerve previous episode, connections body
viscera, including gut, heart, lungs immune system brain,
brain also controlling organs. two-way street.
big myth mentioned before, stimulating vagus various ways
leads calmness. always going calm down. false. just want
repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light
emotionality work done many groups, particular,
going focus work colleague mine, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
psychiatrist, also developed lot tools adjust activity neurons real
time using light electrical stimulation forth. refer article
New Yorker published years ago going read brief
excerpt. put link caption well. talking extremely suicidal
depressed patient small device implanted allows adjust vagus

00:10:53 Understand Emotions: Look Infancy & Puberty

today's going interactive way previous podcast episodes not.
want understand emotions, look emotions first develop.
fact, critical central theme want understand brain science
psychology. rule neuroanatomy. look 50 different brains
humans compare brains dogs humans, lot differences.
Certain things certain things different. rule every good
neuroanatomist knows want understand part brain does,
address two questions. First, know connections
brain area make? connected to? get inputs
send inputs? instance, area brain gets direct input
neurons nose, can pretty certain role analyzing
smell measuring something odors analyzing something odors. Now
also gets input eye, can also conclude gets input visual
system cares light photons. sort obvious. yet need


know connectivity, need know called developmental origin
structure. need know early development, things
move around lot brain develops. brain, course less
squishy thing floating around liquid stuffed inside skull.
consequence, things move around lot. not always place two
different species two individuals species. know
started out, started informs well.
talking emotions, cannot point one area brain. can't say
area brain responsible emotions. so-called limbic
system linked emotions various ways. going talk
today. limbic system just one component inputs create emotions.
not place emotions. can't go lesion one location brain
eliminate emotions entirely, just doesn't work way. So, first all, ask,
circuits emotion? brain areas emotion? nowadays
lot debate this. years, thought might circuits,
meaning connections brain generate feeling happy circuits
generate feeling sad, et cetera. challenged. fact, Lisa
Feldman Barrett person really challenged head-on,
good evidence fact circuits probably don't exist. yet think
good evidence circuits brain, limbic circuits circuits shift
overall states overall level alertness calmness, whether not,
bias us toward viewing outside world paying attention going
inside bodies. none makes sense right now, promise will make sense
soon. important thing understand emotions arise brain
body. arise specific connections specific areas
brain body. want understand emotions work, look
emotions built. built infancy, adolescence, puberty,
continues adulthood. groundwork laid early development
small children. think happens baby comes
world. baby comes world. born world without really
understanding things around you. Now, two ways can interact
world always less degree
time. interoception, paying attention going inside you, feel
internally, exteroception, paying attention going outside you. Hold


mind, please. fact interocepting exterocepting true
entire life, sets foundation understanding emotions. absolutely
critical. infant, didn't knowledge needed. didn't
understand hunger, didn't understand toys first came world,

00:15:21 First Feeling Anxiety

didn't understand cold heat that. needed something,
experienced anxiety. feel increase alertness use
bathroom. feel increase alertness hungry,
vocalize, cry out, act agitated. might cue, might
number different things, knew feeling internally.
caregiver, whoever might've respond that.
feel agitation, caregiver come make decision, Oh, need food,
give milk, change diaper wrap blanket cold,
didn't know cold, just assume cold.
actually really important understand baby, baby,
baby, didn't sense outside world except responded
acts anxiety essentially. Now isn't Freudian theory, components
embedded Freudian theory, developmental psychologists agree
babies lack ability make cognitive sense outside world, feeling
anxiety registering one's internal state, crying outside world,
either crying subtle vocalizations, even just cuing, making noise,
start develop relationship outside world internal states,
shifts anxiety start drive requests, people come respond
requests, hopefully. reason say hopefully heard presumably
cases neglect. lot cases neglect baby,
neglect adolescent teenager, development doesn't go well, touch
those. really extreme cases. sort like parallel
experiments often done laboratory animals, probably
heard enriched environments give mice bunch toys,
give different foods every while, house together
mice. find animals, will say, "Oh, brain
thicker neurons branches that." really


comparing deprivation normalcy.

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't
know, can guess, don't know. fact, time don't even know
feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say
right now feel high energy pleasant. just revealed feel. click
that, gives gallery colors, just move finger
location think matches most. that, little words pop up. know
people listening audio only. say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
say, feeling right now, cheerful. click just go
next window, just says, doing? feels like play me,
going call work. it. basically starts
collect data you. giving information. starts link features
allowed access like, starts helping able predict

quite interesting. points couple really interesting features,
don't really enough language describe emotional states, yet
core truths

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,

dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.

00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,

current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way

interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male

protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big

think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via Body

going talk month hormones. talking
neuroscience emotions, talk vagus nerve. described
vagus nerve previous episode, connections body
viscera, including gut, heart, lungs immune system brain,
brain also controlling organs. two-way street.
big myth mentioned before, stimulating vagus various ways
leads calmness. always going calm down. false. just want
repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light
emotionality work done many groups, particular,
going focus work colleague mine, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
psychiatrist, also developed lot tools adjust activity neurons real
time using light electrical stimulation forth. refer article
New Yorker published years ago going read brief
excerpt. put link caption well. talking extremely suicidal
depressed patient small device implanted allows adjust vagus
nerve activity. Now vagus stimulation originally developed treatment
epilepsy. now used various purposes. Vagus stimulation can even
increase plasticity, seems. again, increasing activity vagus increases
alertness, just incredible see happens real time emotionality
vagus stimulated, again, not calming, activating alertness. office


talking, asks doing, describes

discussion today around infancy puberty. also going talk tools
enhancing one's emotional range navigating difficult emotional situations.
not clinical psychologist, not therapist, background
psychology. today going drawing psychology greats, not me,
greats psychology studied emotion, studied emotional
development, linking neuroscience emotion. nowadays
understand lot chemicals hormones neural circuits
brain body underlie emotion. no one single universally true
theory emotion, intersection many existing theories, really
ground truth. today going visit ground truths. going talk

order tap mechanisms referring to.

00:10:53 Understand Emotions: Look Infancy & Puberty

today's going interactive way previous podcast episodes not.
want understand emotions, look emotions first develop.
fact, critical central theme want understand brain science
psychology. rule neuroanatomy. look 50 different brains
humans compare brains dogs humans, lot differences.
Certain things certain things different. rule every good
neuroanatomist knows want understand part brain does,
address two questions. First, know connections
brain area make? connected to? get inputs
send inputs? instance, area brain gets direct input
neurons nose, can pretty certain role analyzing
smell measuring something odors analyzing something odors. Now
also gets input eye, can also conclude gets input visual
system cares light photons. sort obvious. yet need


know connectivity, need know called developmental origin
structure. need know early development, things
move around lot brain develops. brain, course less
squishy thing floating around liquid stuffed inside skull.
consequence, things move around lot. not always place two
different species two individuals species. know
started out, started informs well.
talking emotions, cannot point one area brain. can't say
area brain responsible emotions. so-called limbic
system linked emotions various ways. going talk
today. limbic system just one component inputs create emotions.
not place emotions. can't go lesion one location brain
eliminate emotions entirely, just doesn't work way. So, first all, ask,
circuits emotion? brain areas emotion? nowadays
lot debate this. years, thought might circuits,
meaning connections brain generate feeling happy circuits
generate feeling sad, et cetera. challenged. fact, Lisa
Feldman Barrett person really challenged head-on,
good evidence fact circuits probably don't exist. yet think
good evidence circuits brain, limbic circuits circuits shift
overall states overall level alertness calmness, whether not,
bias us toward viewing outside world paying attention going
inside bodies. none makes sense right now, promise will make sense
soon. important thing understand emotions arise brain
body. arise specific connections specific areas
brain body. want understand emotions work, look
emotions built. built infancy, adolescence, puberty,
continues adulthood. groundwork laid early development
small children. think happens baby comes
world. baby comes world. born world without really
understanding things around you. Now, two ways can interact
world always less degree
time. interoception, paying attention going inside you, feel
internally, exteroception, paying attention going outside you. Hold


mind, please. fact interocepting exterocepting true
entire life, sets foundation understanding emotions. absolutely
critical. infant, didn't knowledge needed. didn't
understand hunger, didn't understand toys first came world,

00:15:21 First Feeling Anxiety

didn't understand cold heat that. needed something,
experienced anxiety. feel increase alertness use
bathroom. feel increase alertness hungry,
vocalize, cry out, act agitated. might cue, might
number different things, knew feeling internally.
caregiver, whoever might've respond that.
feel agitation, caregiver come make decision, Oh, need food,
give milk, change diaper wrap blanket cold,
didn't know cold, just assume cold.
actually really important understand baby, baby,
baby, didn't sense outside world except responded
acts anxiety essentially. Now isn't Freudian theory, components
embedded Freudian theory, developmental psychologists agree
babies lack ability make cognitive sense outside world, feeling
anxiety registering one's internal state, crying outside world,
either crying subtle vocalizations, even just cuing, making noise,
start develop relationship outside world internal states,
shifts anxiety start drive requests, people come respond
requests, hopefully. reason say hopefully heard presumably
cases neglect. lot cases neglect baby,
neglect adolescent teenager, development doesn't go well, touch
those. really extreme cases. sort like parallel
experiments often done laboratory animals, probably
heard enriched environments give mice bunch toys,
give different foods every while, house together
mice. find animals, will say, "Oh, brain
thicker neurons branches that." really


comparing deprivation normalcy.

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't
know, can guess, don't know. fact, time don't even know
feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say
right now feel high energy pleasant. just revealed feel. click
that, gives gallery colors, just move finger
location think matches most. that, little words pop up. know
people listening audio only. say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
say, feeling right now, cheerful. click just go
next window, just says, doing? feels like play me,
going call work. it. basically starts
collect data you. giving information. starts link features
allowed access like, starts helping able predict
going feel different times day. actually quite accurate certain ways,
quite interesting. points couple really interesting features,
don't really enough language describe emotional states, yet
core truths

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

can powerful understand look emotions lens.
return infant. baby crib. mostly interocepting.
caregivers bring needs, hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, warm
blanket cold, pull off blanket baby's fussing warm, 'cause
babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs
going met degree not. Sometimes sadly neglect. Sometimes
people don't show us way like. general, responses
whether not predict whether not not.
expect something doesn't happen, big let down. discussion
dopamine last episode. many theories emotion, triune brain theory,
primitive involved brain, something little bit shaky ground
days. idea Darwin proposed, universal expressions
emotions. work Helen Fisher love, circuits brain lost
circuits brain, love circuits brain long-term bonds, well
work Lisa Feldman Barrett, saying emotions contextual,
social component. talking this, work Allan Schore,
clinical psychologist researcher UCLA, right brain, left brain, role
emotional development. strong elements idea paying attention
going inward outward. young creature, infant young
toddler, mainly focused inward, started understand going
outward way predicting bring relief, remove
anxiety. fundamental rules experience, emotional
experience laid down. realized lot information somewhat
academic talk, two tools just want highlight, one
Mood Meter app. interested in, can give insight different
kinds nuance within emotions allow actually predict emotional states,
want try might find interesting. one idea
three axes two emotion, three continuum interact, level alertness
calmness, good bad feel, whether not mainly focused inward
outward,



00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things
reliable, people reliable, able give interoception.
literally trust interoceptive needs internal needs will met
bonds actions others. starts veer toward discussion neglect
trauma. going devote entire episodes, probably entire month trauma
PTSD. roots talking now. important
internalize understand talking now order get
future conversations. seems like lot information
complicated, just invite pay attention time time much happen

pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown

something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people

controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,

indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal

one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether

hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et

actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness

indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,

world always less degree
time. interoception, paying attention going inside you, feel
internally, exteroception, paying attention going outside you. Hold


mind, please. fact interocepting exterocepting true
entire life, sets foundation understanding emotions. absolutely
critical. infant, didn't knowledge needed. didn't
understand hunger, didn't understand toys first came world,

00:15:21 First Feeling Anxiety

didn't understand cold heat that. needed something,
experienced anxiety. feel increase alertness use
bathroom. feel increase alertness hungry,
vocalize, cry out, act agitated. might cue, might
number different things, knew feeling internally.
caregiver, whoever might've respond that.
feel agitation, caregiver come make decision, Oh, need food,
give milk, change diaper wrap blanket cold,
didn't know cold, just assume cold.
actually really important understand baby, baby,
baby, didn't sense outside world except responded
acts anxiety essentially. Now isn't Freudian theory, components
embedded Freudian theory, developmental psychologists agree
babies lack ability make cognitive sense outside world, feeling
anxiety registering one's internal state, crying outside world,
either crying subtle vocalizations, even just cuing, making noise,
start develop relationship outside world internal states,
shifts anxiety start drive requests, people come respond
requests, hopefully. reason say hopefully heard presumably
cases neglect. lot cases neglect baby,
neglect adolescent teenager, development doesn't go well, touch
those. really extreme cases. sort like parallel
experiments often done laboratory animals, probably
heard enriched environments give mice bunch toys,
give different foods every while, house together
mice. find animals, will say, "Oh, brain
thicker neurons branches that." really


comparing deprivation normalcy.

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't
know, can guess, don't know. fact, time don't even know
feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say
right now feel high energy pleasant. just revealed feel. click
that, gives gallery colors, just move finger
location think matches most. that, little words pop up. know
people listening audio only. say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
say, feeling right now, cheerful. click just go
next window, just says, doing? feels like play me,
going call work. it. basically starts
collect data you. giving information. starts link features
allowed access like, starts helping able predict

quite interesting. points couple really interesting features,
don't really enough language describe emotional states, yet
core truths

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

can powerful understand look emotions lens.
return infant. baby crib. mostly interocepting.
caregivers bring needs, hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, warm
blanket cold, pull off blanket baby's fussing warm, 'cause
babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things
reliable, people reliable, able give interoception.
literally trust interoceptive needs internal needs will met

PTSD. roots talking now. important
internalize understand talking now order get
future conversations. seems like lot information
complicated, just invite pay attention time time much happen
interocepting exterocepting, emotions intensity emotions
will grow shrink depending much interocepting. feeling
extremely sad, outside event made us sad, chances
going balance, extreme grief, extreme sadness going lead
us mostly interoceptive. Whereas feeling extremely happy,
true. Something great happens world, just going feel it.
perception, awareness going internal state. always
tethered outside world degree another. true
infant, true adolescent, true adult. now
want just pause, just shelve discussion interoception, exteroception

00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions Deliberate Overdrive

want talk arguably second most, not, equally important
aspect development relates emotionality relates this,
call trust, ability predict whether not things outside world reliable
not reliable terms ability help meet interoceptive needs.
period puberty. now, talking mainly psychology, not lot
biology, not lot mechanism. now going transition talking
mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty absolute biological event.


beginning, specific definition, transition reproductive
maturity. lot hormonal changes. Yes, also lot brain
changes. people don't realize it, brain changes occur first. brain
turns hormone systems

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex

vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light

00:15:21 First Feeling Anxiety

didn't understand cold heat that. needed something,
experienced anxiety. feel increase alertness use
bathroom. feel increase alertness hungry,
vocalize, cry out, act agitated. might cue, might
number different things, knew feeling internally.
caregiver, whoever might've respond that.
feel agitation, caregiver come make decision, Oh, need food,
give milk, change diaper wrap blanket cold,
didn't know cold, just assume cold.
actually really important understand baby, baby,
baby, didn't sense outside world except responded
acts anxiety essentially. Now isn't Freudian theory, components
embedded Freudian theory, developmental psychologists agree
babies lack ability make cognitive sense outside world, feeling
anxiety registering one's internal state, crying outside world,
either crying subtle vocalizations, even just cuing, making noise,
start develop relationship outside world internal states,
shifts anxiety start drive requests, people come respond
requests, hopefully. reason say hopefully heard presumably
cases neglect. lot cases neglect baby,
neglect adolescent teenager, development doesn't go well, touch
those. really extreme cases. sort like parallel

comparing deprivation normalcy.

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't

feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say
right now feel high energy pleasant. just revealed feel. click

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

can powerful understand look emotions lens.
return infant. baby crib. mostly interocepting.
caregivers bring needs, hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, warm
blanket cold, pull off blanket baby's fussing warm, 'cause
babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs
going met degree not. Sometimes sadly neglect. Sometimes
people don't show us way like. general, responses

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try

current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way

interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area

pheromone chemical released one member species goes

instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,

significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male

really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty

come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males

00:17:36 “Healthy Emotions”?

want center today instead happens things go well,
things might not go well certain circumstances interesting. me, not
interesting healthy emotional development looks like. haven't
achieved healthy emotional development, can done intervention later
times order rescue that? baby, baby, flopping around
crib, getting care need need it, presumably,
gets basis emotions about, emotions really
forming bonds able predict things world. really
emotions about. Whether not baby feels angry happy sad, don't
know, can guess, don't know. fact, time don't even know
feel, let alone people feel, true adults. asked
feel right now, don't know tell kind rich language
say, "Oh really understand." said very, depressed
very, happy, sense extreme is, don't know
really know, don't think know feel right now either.
furious right now happy, don't idea. course,
things called expressions, pupils dilate. various cues
people feel. going talk cues, really don't know.
point actually just want pause

00:19:03 Digital Tool Predicting Emotions: Mood Meter App

mention really interesting tool trying address question
emotions consist of, can use like. app, didn't
develop it, don't relationship them, app developed people
Yale, groups Yale research, called Mood Meter. actually
quite interesting. think either free 0.99. Again, no business relationship
them. trying put nuance, subtlety words,
language emotions, able allow predict going feel
future. actually quite interesting. app right now, know


can't see this, called Mood Meter. can find Apple Android.
go asks you, says me, "Hi, Andrew, right now? click
little tab says feel. can either pick high energy unpleasant, high
energy pleasant, low energy unpleasant low energy pleasant. say
right now feel high energy pleasant. just revealed feel. click
that, gives gallery colors, just move finger
location think matches most. that, little words pop up. know
people listening audio only. say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
say, feeling right now, cheerful. click just go
next window, just says, doing? feels like play me,
going call work. it. basically starts
collect data you. giving information. starts link features
allowed access like, starts helping able predict
going feel different times day. actually quite accurate certain ways,
quite interesting. points couple really interesting features,
don't really enough language describe emotional states, yet
core truths

00:21:08 Architecture Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions Ask

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

can powerful understand look emotions lens.
return infant. baby crib. mostly interocepting.
caregivers bring needs, hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, warm
blanket cold, pull off blanket baby's fussing warm, 'cause
babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs
going met degree not. Sometimes sadly neglect. Sometimes
people don't show us way like. general, responses
whether not predict whether not not.
expect something doesn't happen, big let down. discussion

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things
reliable, people reliable, able give interoception.
literally trust interoceptive needs internal needs will met
bonds actions others. starts veer toward discussion neglect
trauma. going devote entire episodes, probably entire month trauma
PTSD. roots talking now. important
internalize understand talking now order get
future conversations. seems like lot information
complicated, just invite pay attention time time much happen
interocepting exterocepting, emotions intensity emotions
will grow shrink depending much interocepting. feeling
extremely sad, outside event made us sad, chances
going balance, extreme grief, extreme sadness going lead
us mostly interoceptive. Whereas feeling extremely happy,
true. Something great happens world, just going feel it.
perception, awareness going internal state. always
tethered outside world degree another. true
infant, true adolescent, true adult. now
want just pause, just shelve discussion interoception, exteroception
moment.

00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions Deliberate Overdrive

want talk arguably second most, not, equally important
aspect development relates emotionality relates this,
call trust, ability predict whether not things outside world reliable
not reliable terms ability help meet interoceptive needs.
period puberty. now, talking mainly psychology, not lot
biology, not lot mechanism. now going transition talking
mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty absolute biological event.


beginning, specific definition, transition reproductive
maturity. lot hormonal changes. Yes, also lot brain
changes. people don't realize it, brain changes occur first. brain
turns hormone systems

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not
just reproductively competent, course, shift
number things underlie social bonds, market shift number
things allow children adults

Italian colleagues said me, [speaks foreign language], means like

varies language. One reasons find Italian beautiful, not Italian

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via Body

going talk month hormones. talking

big myth mentioned before, stimulating vagus various ways
leads calmness. always going calm down. false. just want
repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light
emotionality work done many groups, particular,
going focus work colleague mine, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
psychiatrist, also developed lot tools adjust activity neurons real
time using light electrical stimulation forth. refer article
New Yorker published years ago going read brief
excerpt. put link caption well. talking extremely suicidal
depressed patient small device implanted allows adjust vagus
nerve activity. Now vagus stimulation originally developed treatment
epilepsy. now used various purposes. Vagus stimulation can even
increase plasticity, seems. again, increasing activity vagus increases
alertness, just incredible see happens real time emotionality
vagus stimulated, again, not calming, activating alertness. office

makes emotion. want review twice today's podcast,
can really help people, kids adults understand better
feeling why, best engage certain activities, thankfully, best
avoid certain activities too. way works following. need ask
point, right now like, level
autonomic arousal? Autonomic arousal just continuum, range alert calm.
panic right now, like 10 10 arousal scale.
asleep, probably not comprehending saying, although maybe little bit.
say drowsy, might one two. always
ask, arousal scale? axis,
question, call valence. Now valence value. feel good
bad? say feel pretty good right now. scale one 10, like, dunno,
feel like seven. Got good night's sleep last night, good walk Costello
morning, fed, hydrated. feel good, like seven. alert feel


pretty good. third thing, much interocepting
much exterocepting. much attention focused internally
feeling much focused externally. always going
dynamic balance. instance, really, really stressed, oftentimes
puts position really touch going body. start
lot somatic, lot bodily sensations, like heart beating fast
can't ignore it, really strongly interoceptive. also sometimes
really stressed someone's stressing somebody sends text
message makes comment YouTube thing posted something,
really triggered it. never happens me. happen you,
exterocepting. three things, alert sleepy are, one,
good bad feel, two, whether not attention
directed outward, whether not directed inward. much call
emotions made three things. return now development,
tuck away just kind think it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
focused internally focused externally. looked theories
emotion there, lot different components them,
seem center back three features way degree
another.

00:24:00 Infant: Bonds & Predictions

can powerful understand look emotions lens.
return infant. baby crib. mostly interocepting.
caregivers bring needs, hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, warm
blanket cold, pull off blanket baby's fussing warm, 'cause
babies get warm also, starts exterocept. Excuse me, misspoke, want
clear, starts exterocept. baby starts look outside world start
making predictions. starts wondering much needs cry predicting, "Well,
cry like little bit, mom comes get milk. cry lot, mom doesn't
come give milk, need really scream top head."
babies starting evaluate this, not consciously.
strategically order relieve anxiety. won't propose
adulthood. lot adulthood feel


something, start exterocepting. people much better just sitting
container just interocepting paying attention feeling internally.
people little bit balance both. don't feel good, look
item food might make us feel better. feeling anxious heading
dentist something like that, text somebody. almost reflexively,
not always conscious. infants this, continue this. start now
balance interoceptive exteroceptive focus, looking inward looking outward.
that, starting figure gets needs met. Remember,
emotions really form bonds make predictions. needs
going met degree not. Sometimes sadly neglect. Sometimes
people don't show us way like. general, responses
whether not predict whether not not.

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things
reliable, people reliable, able give interoception.
literally trust interoceptive needs internal needs will met

trauma. going devote entire episodes, probably entire month trauma
PTSD. roots talking now. important
internalize understand talking now order get
future conversations. seems like lot information
complicated, just invite pay attention time time much happen
interocepting exterocepting, emotions intensity emotions
will grow shrink depending much interocepting. feeling
extremely sad, outside event made us sad, chances
going balance, extreme grief, extreme sadness going lead
us mostly interoceptive. Whereas feeling extremely happy,
true. Something great happens world, just going feel it.

pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing

significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,

given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons

rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological

someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment

00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external

emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car

even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce

exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try

current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way

interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes

instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,

significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press

really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness

indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction

seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused

classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running

not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use

even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people

recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned

Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone

seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published

distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding

that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly

not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.

one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed

actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin

interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light

00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges Handle Disappointment

going form useful tool kit information going forward.
now talk kind baby were, actually informs
emotionality now. classic. actually famous experiments done
Bowlby Ainsworth. Anyone study psychology taken psychology class
might learned this. classic experiment called
strange situation task which, describing coarsely here, realize.
mother child come laboratory. Yes, now also done fathers.
baby mother father play together bit, mother leaves.
mother leaves period time comes back. research
devoted understanding response child caretaker, mother
father returns, children, not every child, children will cry
primary caretaker leaves. don't like that. good reasons that.
formed bond attachment. will talk deeper chemical
reasons bonds. However, experiment focused return
caregiver. Bowlby Ainsworth, many scientific offspring
colleagues identified least four patterns babies display caretaker
returns, group group a, b, c, d, much kids
referred babies, b babies, c babies d babies. may know one
were. categories really interesting. first babies babies.
kids get upset caretaker leave.
caretaker return, infant respond happiness, looked like
delight. go caretaker. seemed happy. fussy
sad, felt relieved. referred secure attached kids.
healthy response separation, healthy response re-engaging
caretaker. b babies called less likely seek comfort
caregiver caregiver return. sometimes continue
play toys adult room parent gone,
stay them. sometimes complicated nuanced,
referred avoidant babies. Don't run away conclusions language
just yet. not clear avoidant babies become avoidant adults, bear
me. c babies respond return caregiver acts annoyance.


seemed kind angry. wasn't ignored them, seem kind
angry. referred ambivalent babies, not confused
babies. c babies, ambivalent babies. infant's reaction
returning caregiver inconsistent. seemed like wanted bond
seem kind annoyed. think felt way
people care much about, especially people care much about.
third category, d babies, disorganized babies, call
them. weren't disorganized messy, child avoided
interactions everyone acted fearful caregiver returned,
behavior didn't really change whether not caregiver not.
fourth category actually added rather late course research.
mention experiments repeated huge variety different contexts.
work done Mary Main UC Berkeley many others, looking sorts
variations theme. time, made clear certain babies able
feel secure upon re-engaging caregiver others don't, confused
it. probably don't know whether not a, b c, d baby, unless
experiments somehow knowledge. work,
classic work opened huge set important questions relate
reestablishment bond really about. mean, actually figured
not whether not four categories babies,

00:32:40 “Glue Points” Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)

interesting, presumably interesting focus defines
really good bond, secure attachment, insecure attachment avoidant
attachment. four things gaze. literally eye contact, doesn't
direct beaming eye contact no blinks like people accused before. can
just gaze, people look other, see couples, look other,
don't always stare long periods time, sometimes do. Vocalizations,
say say it. Affect emotion, way express it, crying,
smiling et cetera, touch, four things. probably add fifth
dimension language written language develops, written word,
exchange letters, exchange texts, exchange things sort, emails,
another way people can bond. gaze, vocalization, affect touch


really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running
room. indeed kid like, don't know, kid beating kid
kid's beating kid, kid injure feels emotionally
injured. perception voices. good evidence support fact
tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use
children. core elements. look somebody look
you, say, say, seem feeling, makes
feel, smiles, frowns. know someone really well, can read inflections, like
even little subtle things like, mm, don't really believe me, or, oh really excited
this, or, oh, now know thinking. kind processing, people
better others, everyone's better people
recognize know. fact, couples come know exceedingly well,
much can benefit injure relationship constantly making
perceptions. range. people tuned
others. probably roots sorts attachments form early on.
Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face
processing gaze vocalizations touch, happen return
mother, weren't parsing those, weren't looking individually.
raises really interesting question, is, feel something?
something happened spontaneously us, memory,
something realize, saw internet got news somebody?
Nowadays people get much information people know, people
like dislike way viewing online activities.



00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.

one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror

perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,

respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish

current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way

interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area

instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large

pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,

perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press

Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male

really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts

way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin

really core thing call social bonds emotionality. Now
important. know instance brain areas like fusiform face area
deep brain responsible processing faces. Children's
recognition parents' faces voices extremely accurate strong. Likewise,
parents recognition child's vocalizations not just voices, cries remarkable.
ever experience party somebody small
children talking them, sudden hear something
don't, got wolf hearing, sudden, go running

tuned frequencies voices vocalizations people care about.
not just true rodents birds mammals, definitely true humans
well. babies tuned sound mother's voice, even, yes,
womb. whole world called mother-ease,
particular style speech mothers caretakers now know use

Bowlby colleagues develop a, b, c, d thing. lot face

00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good

going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not
just reproductively competent, course, shift

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self

respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species

repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light

00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic

exterocepting, impacting internal state. clear
theories emotional health, ability recognize
internal state driven primarily external events, important able
emotionally regulate. People constantly yanked around external
happenings world, say emotionally labile, not control
emotions, even calm time, calmness arrives
placid environment put cracker environment
freak out, well, not really calm. calm far isn't something
disturbing environment. much outside environment disrupts
internal environment everything balance interoception
exteroception. likely roots whether not secure attached
insecure attached, disorganized ambivalent baby. course, can't travel
back time know, hints kind emotionality
us examining two periods development, one adolescence puberty
adulthood.

00:37:50 Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias

can't travel back time, exercise can address
least moment, whether not bias exteroception bias
interoception, whether not better least moment, paying attention
going internally externally. course, will vary circumstance.
think know people that, maybe you, go party get there,
everyone seems talking really good time, wondering
whether not food teeth whether not something
face whether not hair right whether not said something
wrong way, whether not turning red. People also experience lot
public speaking. not just learning clamp level stress, also
much exterocepting, much head, call it.
much focused events around versus events inside you. Actually,
interesting talk people effective athletes


high stress high consequence jobs, talk notion getting
head. much attentional resource, can split two
things, see moment. can anchored one thing. can fully
focused going internally can fully focused going
externally. want effective world, effective quotes,
useful dynamic environments, especially social environments, lot
attention focused outward opposed trying pay attention whether not
saying things correctly tambour voice, less
destructive ability engage socially. exercise. can this.
Please don't driving. just try illustrate allow
experience interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, extent can
move interoception exteroception deliberately. close eyes right now
concentrate contact portion body say chair car
seat, although please, again, don't driving, anywhere are,
even just standing kitchen, laying couch,
trying bring much attention point contact possible.
there, going move attention even deeply say sensation
going gut. full? empty? hungry?
not? heart beating, rate? cadence breathing? Basically
bringing focus attention everything surface skin inward.
going rare thing Huberman Lab Podcast. going introduce
five eight seconds silence order allow little bit. Now
exercise can continue afterward want extend long this.
now try something that, people actually little bit harder,
purely exterocept, put eyes ears, anything immediate
space, one thing. restrict thing something small enough least
field view occupy 20% field view. doesn't
pinpoint unless pin right front holding real close. say,
look across room, pick panel wall leg table something, try
bring much attention possible. again, take five
seconds silence allow exterocept. probably found
able that, degree interoception maintained. hard
place 100% attention something externally, unless really exciting, really
novel. ever watched really great movie, presumably exterocepting


interoceptive something exciting happens feel
something.

00:42:19 Getting Head: Attentional Aperture

actually tethering emotional experience something external. now
can also dynamically. can decide focus internally externally. can
decide split 50%, 50% 70/30. can develop heightened ability this.
power actually environments feel like
focused much internally like focused externally, can
actually deliberately. notice, takes work, involves taking
attentional spotlight, call aperture attention, narrowing
aperture either self something externally splitting two. yet
practices developed center moving interoception
exteroception one heavily weighted other, focused
outward focused inward. dynamic. circuits brain
underlie intero exteroception aren't exactly known, anchored
areas brain involved attention, like frontal eye fields areas
third-person yourself, can see something, like
put hand environment focus hand, know
hand opposed random object. areas brain
involved that, recognizing location self relative rest body.
exercises really core development emotional bonds.
mentioned before, four things, gaze, vocalization, touch
affect, happening dynamically. somebody winks you,
paying attention wink, also notice feel. might say
something, might say something, dynamic. seems
overwhelming try interocept exterocept shift balance,
time. brain nervous system fantastic this. Now,
people hard time breaking strongly interoceptive mode.
people harder time breaking exteroceptive mode. interesting
note extent biases interoceptive exteroceptive are.
Remember three axes talked earlier, valence, good
bad, alertness, alert calm, interoceptive exteroceptive bias.


going differ across day, going differ across lifetime. certainly
going differ according whatever engaged in. early
development, start off interoceptive bias. starting develop
expectations, predictions outside world going work.
trying figure reliability outside events people. things

want just pause, just shelve discussion interoception, exteroception
moment.

00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions Deliberate Overdrive

want talk arguably second most, not, equally important
aspect development relates emotionality relates this,
call trust, ability predict whether not things outside world reliable
not reliable terms ability help meet interoceptive needs.
period puberty. now, talking mainly psychology, not lot
biology, not lot mechanism. now going transition talking
mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty absolute biological event.


beginning, specific definition, transition reproductive
maturity. lot hormonal changes. Yes, also lot brain
changes. people don't realize it, brain changes occur first. brain
turns hormone systems

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not
just reproductively competent, course, shift

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific

rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy

seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,

not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase

always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin
kisspeptin. young child now different creature extent, not

primarily handling stuff, sort non-language except one aspect.
isn't ton evidence this, evidence strong, prosody. Prosody


LILting falling language. good example Italian. don't speak
Italian. know little bit Italian, Italian know
Italian colleagues said me, [speaks foreign language], means like
trying say, saying? think getting right. Basically
saying don't speak Italian, true. one knows loves
Costello much, always say [speaks foreign language], means big, lazy
guy, accurately captures Costello. even examples, [speaks
foreign language], lot LILt fall Italian, languages, not much.
varies language. One reasons find Italian beautiful, not Italian
speak, Italian people speak beautiful listen prosody
shifts intonation really quite remarkable. almost like singing song
listening speak. used like go scientific meetings. always hang
Italians, 'cause good friends Italian labs, also 'cause
always knew best food was, standards food incredible.
rather starve eat terrible pasta, pasta find
willing eat always fantastic. addition that, always brought guitar.
lot fun lot colleagues hang meetings.
event, right brain things manipulating spatial

really careful work

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.

one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat
order allow metabolic factors processes occur liberate fat.
people trouble losing last five pounds. leptin levels
low. actually basis whole cheat day, refeed thing, idea
eat lot one day week dieting hard, can signal brain
enough leptin. don't know reason whether not cheat days
just provided psychological relief, probably both. case, leptin made
body fat. enough leptin, signals brain trigger puberty.
paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing
leptin injected younger females not yet gone
puberty. accelerate onset puberty leptin. body fat,
earlier puberty, true. Leptin also involved various growth effects body
generally. interesting, obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty
earlier. Sometimes do, tend larger boned. bones actually
grow quickly, tend higher bone density leptin also
involved bone density. whole issue onset puberty also really
interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area


body, travels, impacts tissues cells elsewhere body.

00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage

pheromone chemical released one member species goes
acts impacts members species even species.
instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular

world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described

always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.

one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin

interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: Leptin Connection

allow puberty occur. Puberty occurring earlier nowadays past.
current numbers able find females girls, transition
starting around age 10, whereas boys, age 12, going differ way
number different factors. averages. depends
world, depends sorts things. One primary triggers puberty
actually body fat. interesting. peptide hormone, leptin, people call
peptide, people call hormone, meets definitions depending
look it, made fat. leptin lot popularity '90s,
discovered produced fat, seen animal studies
promote leanness. actually communicates brain enough body fat

paper published mid '90s Journal Science, excellent journal, showing

interesting social effects. want really highlight effects, also
called pheromone effects. Remember hormone substance secreted one area

instance, rodents good detecting urine scent markings large
carnivores want eat them. pheromone interaction. Whether not
pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,
synchronization menstrual cycles. Many people report, people say
studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male

protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy

seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,

that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin

not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

pheromonal effects humans debated. post Instagram
little ago pheromone effects reported humans.
couple people come saying, "Look, never really shown
humans pheromonal vomer," called vomeronasal organ.
something called Jacobson's organ. rudimentary. people it, people
don't, controversial. want point human pheromone effects
controversial. Although think there's, opinion, ample evidence them,

studies show not true. there've data showing
impressive pheromonal effects female partners able detect odor
significant others t-shirts washed several times. can't consciously
perceive it, say one smells like them, one smells like partner.
indeed, match way chance. seem weak pheromonal
effects least opinion look data, much needs done.
one interesting pheromone effects impacts puberty, least
animal models so-called Vandenbergh effect, is, take pre-pubertal
female, female not undergone sexual maturation, introduce
novel male not father brother, not sibling, will undergo puberty
almost immediately. really striking. years, thought not occur
primate species, paper published last year Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, showing mandrills, particular type primate, exhibit
Vandenbergh effect. also sorts pheromone effects.
infamous one called Bruce effect, introduction novel male
pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage. effect seems
protected presence father. interpretation this, want
really highlight animal studies, way works pregnant


female company male impregnated her, young protected
scent presence pheromone presence. gone novel male
shows up, tendency spontaneously miscarry, essentially
fetus lost. Now, whether not occurs humans still controversial,
nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.
puberty happens biological level, gets triggered leptin

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy

children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published

visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described

always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly

not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via Body

going talk month hormones. talking

vagus nerve previous episode, connections body
viscera, including gut, heart, lungs immune system brain,

big myth mentioned before, stimulating vagus various ways
leads calmness. always going calm down. false. just want
repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light
emotionality work done many groups, particular,
going focus work colleague mine, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
psychiatrist, also developed lot tools adjust activity neurons real
time using light electrical stimulation forth. refer article
New Yorker published years ago going read brief
excerpt. put link caption well. talking extremely suicidal
depressed patient small device implanted allows adjust vagus
nerve activity. Now vagus stimulation originally developed treatment
epilepsy. now used various purposes. Vagus stimulation can even
increase plasticity, seems. again, increasing activity vagus increases

nonetheless, pheromone effects exist. one called Bruce effect,
named Hilda Bruce, scientist discovered it. one relevant
puberty discussion Vandenbergh effect, mentioned minutes
ago, novel male showing up, sexually competent male,
already passed puberty, presence triggers activation puberty
female otherwise remained pre-pubertal longer. Again, whether
not happens humans unclear. Well, can sure
think puberty? Puberty triggered number different factors.

00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent

changes GABA expression brain, inhibitory transmitter. One
interesting molecules triggers puberty individuals something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin made brain.
stimulates large amounts different hormone called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone released. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone causes release
another hormone called luteinizing hormone LH, travels bloodstream
stimulates ovaries females produce estrogen testes males
produce testosterone. Kisspeptin effects well.
main ones relate puberty. interesting, point, testes
males start churning tons testosterone order trigger development
secondary sexual characteristics, body hair others, deepening voice, et
cetera. females, estrogen various things, breast development, et
cetera. Normally, adult, somebody passed puberty, big increase
gonadotropin releasing hormone luteinizing hormone eventually shut
down, way brain works, hypothalamus pituitary
actually measuring much hormone blood. testosterone estrogen
hormone goes high, shut release things like luteinizing
hormone. called negative feedback loop. Basically like thermostat house.
complicated that, levels get high blood stream, shuts


down. kisspeptin able drive high levels hormones ongoing
way puberty can commence can continue. incidentally, kisspeptin
now become yet another panoply hormones peptides cocktails
athletes take order try stimulate natural hormone production, essentially
create performance-enhancing drugs endogenously. No judgment there,
fact, lot kisspeptin used. truly not suggesting anyone this,
people buying injecting kisspeptin specific reason even past puberty
can stimulate large increases things like estrogen, large increases testosterone
things sort. number psychological effects too, seems big
effects libido, et cetera. things course subject feedback loops,
don't work indefinitely. going highlight, again, not suggesting anyone
it, like pay attention there. kisspeptin, wasn't
discovered long ago one things don't often hear
people talk performance-enhancing drugs therapeutic endocrinology.
things also therapeutic uses endocrine setting. instance, kids
don't undergo puberty kids hypogonadal adults hypogonadal,
not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin among things.

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone

seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular

world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,

side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase

always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

primarily handling stuff, sort non-language except one aspect.
isn't ton evidence this, evidence strong, prosody. Prosody


LILting falling language. good example Italian. don't speak
Italian. know little bit Italian, Italian know
Italian colleagues said me, [speaks foreign language], means like
trying say, saying? think getting right. Basically
saying don't speak Italian, true. one knows loves
Costello much, always say [speaks foreign language], means big, lazy
guy, accurately captures Costello. even examples, [speaks
foreign language], lot LILt fall Italian, languages, not much.
varies language. One reasons find Italian beautiful, not Italian
speak, Italian people speak beautiful listen prosody
shifts intonation really quite remarkable. almost like singing song
listening speak. used like go scientific meetings. always hang
Italians, 'cause good friends Italian labs, also 'cause
always knew best food was, standards food incredible.
rather starve eat terrible pasta, pasta find

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated
extent the, case, males relationships pay attention
visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding
internal state others, requires enhanced exteroception particular
others. not just generally look everywhere see going
world,

01:27:00 Ways Increase Oxytocin

particularly paying attention emotional states others. sure several
will asking, "Well, can increase oxytocin," goal.
evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase
oxytocin release. falls category described
drug injected person animal always effective producing scientific
paper. Meaning can get result, result isn't always robust.
always want read past titles abstracts get meat paper.
that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities

don't know will. think going stick oxytocin got.
molecule make extremely important social bonds emotionality
one going talk month hormones, vasopressin.
Vasopressin suppresses urination. made body, developed
treatment something called diabetes insipidus, people urinate excessively,
actually risk dehydration can lose lot electrolytes, et cetera.
causes water retention. Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin. large amounts
alcohol, many people excrete, lot fluid forth. Vasopressin effects
brain directly. actually creates feelings giddy love. also increases memory
potent ways. whole biohacking community dabbling
vasopressin time. never tried it. certainly don't recommend it.
prescription. pretty serious compound start messing with,
many different effects body. interesting creates sense giddy
love. also used somewhat aphrodisiac, similar oxytocin. also
interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
receptor dictate whether not monogamous not. actually
interesting evidence humans. people report behavior, assuming
reporting accurately, vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate monogamy
non-monogamy humans well.

01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via Body

going talk month hormones. talking

vagus nerve previous episode, connections body
viscera, including gut, heart, lungs immune system brain,
brain also controlling organs. two-way street.
big myth mentioned before, stimulating vagus various ways
leads calmness. always going calm down. false. just want
repeat completely false. fact, just paper, yet another paper published
day, fantastic, David McCormick Lab University
Oregon. published Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, just reading
title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical, neocortex
behavioral activation. read paper, fantastic. illustrates yet again, stimulation
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation brain alertness.
stimulant alertness, not calming people down. Now interesting light
emotionality work done many groups, particular,
going focus work colleague mine, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
psychiatrist, also developed lot tools adjust activity neurons real
time using light electrical stimulation forth. refer article
New Yorker published years ago going read brief
excerpt. put link caption well. talking extremely suicidal

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish

LILting falling language. good example Italian. don't speak
Italian. know little bit Italian, Italian know
Italian colleagues said me, [speaks foreign language], means like

saying don't speak Italian, true. one knows loves
Costello much, always say [speaks foreign language], means big, lazy
guy, accurately captures Costello. even examples, [speaks

varies language. One reasons find Italian beautiful, not Italian
speak, Italian people speak beautiful listen prosody
shifts intonation really quite remarkable. almost like singing song
listening speak. used like go scientific meetings. always hang
Italians, 'cause good friends Italian labs, also 'cause
always knew best food was, standards food incredible.

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone
cortisol levels couple conflict, fight, fight
without oxytocin. interesting. much line idea oxytocin
"trust hormone." sort keeping that. 2009 paper.
evidence, instance, men report greater sense connection intimacy
partners sex taking intranasal oxytocin. studies autistic
children. Giving intranasal oxytocin way try help establish better
social connection "empathy" theory mind. talked theory mind
before, understanding children adults experiencing. Oxytocin


seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published

distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

visual attention attractive potential partners. seemed like general
takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,
depending interpret them. general theme oxytocin
promoting monogamy, promoting pair bonding, promoting understanding

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self
others. Mirror neurons controversial. many neuroscientists
respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member

cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons

rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish

component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological

someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment

01:18:32 Oxytocin: Molecule Synchronizing States

points totally different direction. can't complete conversation
emotions bonds social connection without talking oxytocin. Oxytocin
come prominence last decade so, seems everywhere.


Anytime hear discussion neuroscience brain hormones brain,
oxytocin released response lactation females, released response
sexual interactions. released response non-sexual touch. released males
females, indeed involved pair bonding establishment social
bonds general. seems matching internal state. seems
increase synchrony internal state somehow, maybe sets level calmness
alertness. seems like reasonable hypothesis, well raising people's
awareness emotional state partner. again, brings us back
alertness calmness axis interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. order form good
bonds, can't just thinking feel, also need paying attention
others feel, evaluating match. trying see whether not
seems sort synchrony states.

01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Not “Empathy”, Maybe Predicting Behavior

oxytocin, seems increase synchrony increase awareness
emotional state others. Now know many probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons. Mirror, neurons, may know,
perhaps may not, neurons discovered animals humans
ability respond people engage certain physical actions like lifting pen,
neurons respond somebody watched someone else lift pen.
really mirrors of, representing mirrors behavior, self

respect lot, don't think exist, look data, data,
least mind interpreted realm empathy assigning value
emotional states others. look literature, opinion
indeed neurons brain clearly represent actions others,
not clear wired emotion empathy system direct way.
think growing consensus mirror neurons, name terrific
catchy, encompasses much love encompass,
data don't really support that. controversial, perfectly happy get
experts debate better could. however neurons
brain discovered colleague, Keren Haroush Stanford
working Noam Ziv's Lab, clearly point fact primate species


making assumptions trying predict behavior members
species. experiment, don't time go real detail, probably
just get Keren here. familiar prisoner's dilemma,
really model cooperation, can either cooperate one member
given interaction can cooperate one won't, can not
cooperate. ways can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma,
looking previous behavior making predictions likely next behavior
individual will engage in. seem neurons
sorts predictions computations. Again, go detail future.
rather thinking mirror neurons, like neurons empathy, think
correct think neurons trying predict behavior others.

01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy

that's, said, one core features emotions, establish
bonds, bonds, able predict behavior. oxytocin one
component ability predict others' behavior guide behavior.
experiments involve administration intranasal oxytocin. Now
think need prescription, although places don't. people
taking intranasal oxytocin order try increase depth bonding.
don't recommend that. never tried that. Whatever oxytocin released,
made without intranasal exogenous application. reported
increased positive communication among couples. people taken intranasal
oxytocin studies. study, like, published Biological
Psychiatry, psychiatry colleagues tell fine journal. title
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication reduces stress hormone

seem create general effects, nuanced one situation
another, don't know. aware told, definitely not recommending this,
marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now no idea. Maybe
someone can put comments want combine oxytocin ketamine.
can't imagine why. Ketamine dissociative anesthetic used treatment
PTSD. used used recreational drug. similar PCP, seems quite
dangerous fact. don't know two things combined, one
want combine them. products seem combine two
things. not certain one that, interesting note
happening. particularly interesting study oxytocin that, published
journal, Neuroscience, good journal, oxytocin modulates social
distance males females. interesting. gave
oxytocin people monogamous relationships, evaluated

takeaway study oxytocin administration seemed promote
monogamous behavior. behavior wasn't line monogamy
relationship opposed foraging potentially new mates. Now
course, somewhat artificial experiments artificial experiments,

evidence. invite go examine.com another site like
PubMed want forage PubMed, vitamin D required proper production,
cases can increase levels oxytocin supplemented,
interesting. believe not, melatonin, old friend melatonin,
pushed back supplement sleep, view untoward


side effects melatonin cases, seems like melatonin cases can
prime system slightly increased oxytocin release. even one report,
although didn't look strong low doses caffeine increase

that, effects pretty negligible caffeine oxytocin.
interesting vitamin D melatonin may positive effects oxytocin
release. like said, many people just taking oxytocin directly
intranasal sprays. pretty sure prescription places, check. again,
not recommending anybody that. never tried it.

interesting effects monogamous non-monogamous behavior. This, again,
will revisit future. beautiful set experiments done
little rodent species called prairie vole. turns two different populations
prairie voles, monogamous, always meet prairie
vole, robustly non-monogamous, mate many


prairie voles can. turns levels vasopressin and/or vasopressin
