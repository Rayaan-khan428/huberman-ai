can hear me, amazing means voice causing little tiny
changes airwaves wherever happen be. ears whatever's
contained ears brain can take sound waves make sense
them. absolutely fantastic staggering feat biology yet
understand lot process works. going teach now
simple terms next minutes. call ears technical name.
technical name oracles, often called pinna, pinnas, P-I-N-N-
A, pinna. pinnas ears, outer part made cartilage stuff
arranged can capture sound best way head size. going
talk ear size also, 'cause turns ears change size across
lifespan big ears rather fast ears changing size
pretty good indication fast aging. get minutes,
want talk things call ears stuff contained
within allow us hear. shape ears
amplifies high-frequency sounds. High frequency sounds, name suggests,
squeakier stuff. low frequency sound, Costello snoring background low
frequency sound high frequency sound, okay? low frequency sounds
high frequency sounds everything between. Now sound waves get captured
ears. sound waves, don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves, literally just fluctuations shifts way air
moving toward ear space. way water can waves,
air can waves. reverberation air. come ears
called eardrum. inside eardrum, little
bony thing shaped like little hammer. attached eardrum, can
move back forth like drum, little membrane, got hammer attached
it. hammer three parts. want know, three
parts called malleus, incus stapes. basically, can just think
hammer. got eardrum hammer. hammer


hammer something. hammers little coiled piece tissue
call cochlea, sometimes called cochlea, depending somebody
lives country. So, typically, Midwest, East Coast, call coh-
chleah. West Coast, call caw-cochlea, thing. snail-
shaped structure inner ear sound gets converted electrical signals
brain can understand. want just bring attention little hammer
little hammer really, really cool. means sound waves come
ears, happening right now, eardrum have,
like top drum. like membrane, can move back forth. not super
rigid moves little hammer. hammer goes, doom-doom-doom-
doom hits coil-shaped thing calling cochlea. Now cochlea,
one end, rigid other. one part can move really easily
part doesn't move easily. turns important decoding
separating sounds low frequency like Costello's snoring sounds
high frequency, like shriek shrill. within little coil thing,
call cochlea, tiny little called hair cells. Now look like
hairs, not related hairs head elsewhere body.
just shaped like hair, call hair cells. hair cells, move,
send signals brain particular sound environment. hair
cells don't move, means particular sound not environment. just give
mental picture this, sound waves coming in, stuff
there, making noises like voice; changing patterns air around very,
subtle ways; information getting funneled ears pinnas
shaped particular way. eardrum moves little hammer
hammer bangs little snail-shaped thing. snail-shaped thing,
one end, rigid, doesn't want move end, flexible,
can separate high-frequency low-frequency sounds. fact thing
inner ear call cochlea coiled, actually really important
understand along length, varies rigid flexible is, already
mentioned base, rigid hair cells,
move, will make high-frequency sounds, top, called apex,
flexible like bass drum. basically happens sound waves
come ears one end thing call cochlea, top,
essentially encoding responding sounds like, doom-doom-doom-


doom. Whereas, bottom, responds high-frequency sounds like cymbal,
[clanging]. everywhere between, frequencies, medium
frequencies. Now stagger mind. doesn't already, should.
means everything happening around us, whether not music
voices crying screaming screaming delight small children
excited, 'cause playing 'cause get cake; broken
component parts brain making sense means.
things talking about, like pinna ears little hammer
cochlea, purely mechanical. no mind own. just breaking
things high frequencies, medium frequencies low frequencies.
don't understand sound frequency, really simple understand, just imagine ripples
pond. ripples close together, high frequency; occur
high frequency. ripples apart, low frequency. obviously,
medium frequency between. just like can waves water, can
waves air. really works. Now familiar light
how, take prism put front light, will split light different
wavelengths, different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera. like Pink Floyd "Dark
Side Moon" album, think, prism converting white light
colors, wavelengths contained white light. cochlea, essentially,
acts prism. takes sound environment splits sounds
different frequencies. can think cochlea ear, sort like prism

00:21:56 Hearing Brain (Areas)

information puts back together makes sense it. hair cells
two cochlea, two ears, also two cochlea, send
little wires, call axons convey patterns activity brain.
number different stations within brain information arrives
gets parts brain, consciously aware.
asked names nomenclature, give you.
don't want lot detailed names, can just ignore say. But,
basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump
cells. spiral ganglion bunch neurons information goes off
called cochlear nuclei brainstem. Brainstem near neck,
structure really cool name called superior olive,
one side brain. bring lab show
superior olives brain anyone else's brain, look like little olives, even
little divot me, looks like pimiento, just call
superior olive. neurons superior olive, send information
called inferior colliculus, called inferior sits structure
called superior colliculus. information goes called
medial geniculate nucleus. neocortex make sense
all. Now don't remember that, know lot
stations auditory information processed gets conscious
detection.

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front
you. Disruptions auditory hearing visual matching actually basis
called ventriloquism effect, talk minutes
depth. ventriloquism effect can basically described simple terms
essentially think sound coming location not actually coming
from. talk moment like realize one
stations, deep brainstem responsible helping identify sounds
coming process called interaural time differences. sounds
fancy, really, way know things coming from, direction car


boss person coming sound lands one ear

happens very, fast subconscious now know people really
want hear something, make cup around ear. essentially make

things, big spiky ears, look like French bulldog, although fox
version version French bulldog. big, tall ears, excellent sound
localization. people lean ear, hand like this,
listening this, just cupping hand ear, giving bigger pinna.
left side, can side. really want hear something,

actually, want hear things coming much greater
degree accuracy, can actually help capturing sound waves
funneling better. really remarkable, whole system. got two
ears differences timing things arrive two ears,
well differences frequencies certain things sound, say

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look
ears, ears remarkably similar ears, rather ears remarkably
similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates

movements mean things ear movements
correlate aspects biology, nice paper, actually, scientific
paper. author's last name Code, C-O-D-E, published 1995. give
reference that. review article discusses sex differences ear
movement control, well relationship ear movements eye

interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:33:00 Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role Hormones, Sexual Orientation

biology. guessing not heard this.
describe called otoacoustic emissions. otoacoustic emissions, name
suggests, sounds ears make. Believe not, 70% people make noises
ears, don't actually detect them. Like said, never heard this.
Okay, not mean. mean 70% people's ears
making noise cast ear. otoacoustic emissions, actually, can
detected microphones. Sometimes can detected people
room good hearing. Now, turns women or,
technical here, females report heterosexual, higher
frequency, not frequency sound, higher frequency otoacoustic emissions
men report heterosexual. Women report
homosexual bisexual, make fewer otoacoustic emissions heterosexual women.
data come Dennis McFadden's lab University Texas,
Austin. actually discovered these, called sexual dimorphisms


differences based sexual orientation without looking them. studying
hearing. auditory scientist people coming laboratory
detecting otoacoustic emissions. started notice group
differences otoacoustic emissions. started asking people sex
sexual orientation. differences fell data, say.
interesting otoacoustic emissions not something associate

hormones developing brain body.

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information

sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully

evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal

Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain

chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain

can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused

appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine

thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud

put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't

once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial

enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes

making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

can hear me, amazing means voice causing little tiny
changes airwaves wherever happen be. ears whatever's
contained ears brain can take sound waves make sense
them. absolutely fantastic staggering feat biology yet
understand lot process works. going teach now
simple terms next minutes. call ears technical name.
technical name oracles, often called pinna, pinnas, P-I-N-N-
A, pinna. pinnas ears, outer part made cartilage stuff
arranged can capture sound best way head size. going
talk ear size also, 'cause turns ears change size across
lifespan big ears rather fast ears changing size
pretty good indication fast aging. get minutes,
want talk things call ears stuff contained
within allow us hear. shape ears
amplifies high-frequency sounds. High frequency sounds, name suggests,
squeakier stuff. low frequency sound, Costello snoring background low
frequency sound high frequency sound, okay? low frequency sounds
high frequency sounds everything between. Now sound waves get captured
ears. sound waves, don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves, literally just fluctuations shifts way air
moving toward ear space. way water can waves,
air can waves. reverberation air. come ears
called eardrum. inside eardrum, little
bony thing shaped like little hammer. attached eardrum, can
move back forth like drum, little membrane, got hammer attached
it. hammer three parts. want know, three
parts called malleus, incus stapes. basically, can just think
hammer. got eardrum hammer. hammer


hammer something. hammers little coiled piece tissue
call cochlea, sometimes called cochlea, depending somebody
lives country. So, typically, Midwest, East Coast, call coh-
chleah. West Coast, call caw-cochlea, thing. snail-
shaped structure inner ear sound gets converted electrical signals
brain can understand. want just bring attention little hammer
little hammer really, really cool. means sound waves come
ears, happening right now, eardrum have,
like top drum. like membrane, can move back forth. not super
rigid moves little hammer. hammer goes, doom-doom-doom-
doom hits coil-shaped thing calling cochlea. Now cochlea,
one end, rigid other. one part can move really easily
part doesn't move easily. turns important decoding
separating sounds low frequency like Costello's snoring sounds
high frequency, like shriek shrill. within little coil thing,
call cochlea, tiny little called hair cells. Now look like
hairs, not related hairs head elsewhere body.
just shaped like hair, call hair cells. hair cells, move,
send signals brain particular sound environment. hair
cells don't move, means particular sound not environment. just give
mental picture this, sound waves coming in, stuff
there, making noises like voice; changing patterns air around very,
subtle ways; information getting funneled ears pinnas
shaped particular way. eardrum moves little hammer
hammer bangs little snail-shaped thing. snail-shaped thing,
one end, rigid, doesn't want move end, flexible,
can separate high-frequency low-frequency sounds. fact thing
inner ear call cochlea coiled, actually really important
understand along length, varies rigid flexible is, already
mentioned base, rigid hair cells,
move, will make high-frequency sounds, top, called apex,
flexible like bass drum. basically happens sound waves
come ears one end thing call cochlea, top,
essentially encoding responding sounds like, doom-doom-doom-


doom. Whereas, bottom, responds high-frequency sounds like cymbal,
[clanging]. everywhere between, frequencies, medium
frequencies. Now stagger mind. doesn't already, should.
means everything happening around us, whether not music
voices crying screaming screaming delight small children
excited, 'cause playing 'cause get cake; broken
component parts brain making sense means.
things talking about, like pinna ears little hammer
cochlea, purely mechanical. no mind own. just breaking
things high frequencies, medium frequencies low frequencies.
don't understand sound frequency, really simple understand, just imagine ripples
pond. ripples close together, high frequency; occur
high frequency. ripples apart, low frequency. obviously,
medium frequency between. just like can waves water, can
waves air. really works. Now familiar light
how, take prism put front light, will split light different
wavelengths, different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera. like Pink Floyd "Dark
Side Moon" album, think, prism converting white light
colors, wavelengths contained white light. cochlea, essentially,
acts prism. takes sound environment splits sounds
different frequencies. can think cochlea ear, sort like prism
brain takes

00:21:56 Hearing Brain (Areas)

information puts back together makes sense it. hair cells
two cochlea, two ears, also two cochlea, send
little wires, call axons convey patterns activity brain.
number different stations within brain information arrives
gets parts brain, consciously aware.
asked names nomenclature, give you.
don't want lot detailed names, can just ignore say. But,
basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump
cells. spiral ganglion bunch neurons information goes off
called cochlear nuclei brainstem. Brainstem near neck,
structure really cool name called superior olive,
one side brain. bring lab show
superior olives brain anyone else's brain, look like little olives, even
little divot me, looks like pimiento, just call
superior olive. neurons superior olive, send information
called inferior colliculus, called inferior sits structure
called superior colliculus. information goes called
medial geniculate nucleus. neocortex make sense
all. Now don't remember that, know lot
stations auditory information processed gets conscious
detection.

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front
you. Disruptions auditory hearing visual matching actually basis
called ventriloquism effect, talk minutes
depth. ventriloquism effect can basically described simple terms
essentially think sound coming location not actually coming
from. talk moment like realize one
stations, deep brainstem responsible helping identify sounds
coming process called interaural time differences. sounds
fancy, really, way know things coming from, direction car


boss person coming sound lands one ear
other. stations brain, meaning neurons brain
calculate difference time arrival sound waves right versus
left ear. arrive time, assume thing making noise right
front you. off right, assume right. sound
arrives first left ear, assume, quite correctly, thing coming toward
left ear. simple mechanical system level sound
localization. down? think it, sound coming
going land right ear left ear time. sound
going land right ear left ear time. way
know things terms called elevation,
plane frequencies. shape ears actually modifies
sound depending whether not coming straight you, floor
high above. already level ears, taking information
outside world determining information coming from. Now,
happens very, fast subconscious now know people really
want hear something, make cup around ear. essentially make
ear fennec fox type ear. ever seen cute little fennec fox
things, big spiky ears, look like French bulldog, although fox
version version French bulldog. big, tall ears, excellent sound
localization. people lean ear, hand like this,
listening this, just cupping hand ear, giving bigger pinna.
left side, can side. really want hear something,
sides. isn't just gesturing, actually serves mechanical role.
actually, want hear things coming much greater
degree accuracy, can actually help capturing sound waves
funneling better. really remarkable, whole system. got two
ears differences timing things arrive two ears,
well differences frequencies certain things sound, say
differences frequencies

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look
ears, ears remarkably similar ears, rather ears remarkably
similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates
similar ears; ears, similar ears. interested ear
movements mean things ear movements
correlate aspects biology, nice paper, actually, scientific
paper. author's last name Code, C-O-D-E, published 1995. give
reference that. review article discusses sex differences ear
movement control, well relationship ear movements eye
movements. pretty accessible paper. one think
interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:33:00 Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role Hormones, Sexual Orientation

biology. guessing not heard this.
describe called otoacoustic emissions. otoacoustic emissions, name
suggests, sounds ears make. Believe not, 70% people make noises
ears, don't actually detect them. Like said, never heard this.
Okay, not mean. mean 70% people's ears
making noise cast ear. otoacoustic emissions, actually, can
detected microphones. Sometimes can detected people
room good hearing. Now, turns women or,
technical here, females report heterosexual, higher
frequency, not frequency sound, higher frequency otoacoustic emissions
men report heterosexual. Women report
homosexual bisexual, make fewer otoacoustic emissions heterosexual women.
data come Dennis McFadden's lab University Texas,
Austin. actually discovered these, called sexual dimorphisms


differences based sexual orientation without looking them. studying
hearing. auditory scientist people coming laboratory
detecting otoacoustic emissions. started notice group
differences otoacoustic emissions. started asking people sex
sexual orientation. differences fell data, say.
interesting otoacoustic emissions not something associate
sex sexual dimorphism. data really underscore is, first all, lot us
making noises ears, us others. exposure
certain combinations hormones development likely shaping way
hearing apparati, meaning cochlea pinna sorts things,
develop functions throughout lifespan. episode
hormones sexual development, gets much deeper effects
hormones developing brain body.

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully
asleep. can sort ascend staircase findings here, speak.
find evidence alpha waves, eight 13 hertz can increase alertness
moderate level. great state brain recall existing information.
beta waves, 15 20 hertz great bringing brain focus states
sustained thought incorporating new information especially gamma waves,
highest frequency, frequent ripples sound, speak, 32 100 hertz
learning problem-solving. Now, matches, say, maps onto
said learning really nicely, need highly alert
state order bring new information in, order access state mind
can tell brain brain telling itself, okay, need learn this.
stress unfortunate circumstances memorable brain gets
really high alert system. Here, talking use binaural beats order


increase level alertness level calmness. Now important
underscore not something fundamentally important
binaural beats. yet another way bringing brain states deep
relaxation low frequency sound highly alert states focused learning
high-frequency sound. effective review little bit data
detail, effective, not uniquely special learning. just
can help people bring brain state allows learn
better. lot studies allowed us arrive, say allowed
field arrive parameters slow, slow, low frequency waves going bring
relaxed states, high frequency waves alert states. good
evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense
motivation activate sense desire continue focusing learning.
can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend
number different factors. can't tell turn level two volume controller.
just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene

can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling

particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

can hear me, amazing means voice causing little tiny
changes airwaves wherever happen be. ears whatever's
contained ears brain can take sound waves make sense
them. absolutely fantastic staggering feat biology yet
understand lot process works. going teach now
simple terms next minutes. call ears technical name.
technical name oracles, often called pinna, pinnas, P-I-N-N-
A, pinna. pinnas ears, outer part made cartilage stuff
arranged can capture sound best way head size. going
talk ear size also, 'cause turns ears change size across
lifespan big ears rather fast ears changing size
pretty good indication fast aging. get minutes,
want talk things call ears stuff contained
within allow us hear. shape ears
amplifies high-frequency sounds. High frequency sounds, name suggests,
squeakier stuff. low frequency sound, Costello snoring background low
frequency sound high frequency sound, okay? low frequency sounds
high frequency sounds everything between. Now sound waves get captured
ears. sound waves, don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves, literally just fluctuations shifts way air
moving toward ear space. way water can waves,
air can waves. reverberation air. come ears
called eardrum. inside eardrum, little
bony thing shaped like little hammer. attached eardrum, can
move back forth like drum, little membrane, got hammer attached
it. hammer three parts. want know, three
parts called malleus, incus stapes. basically, can just think
hammer. got eardrum hammer. hammer


hammer something. hammers little coiled piece tissue
call cochlea, sometimes called cochlea, depending somebody
lives country. So, typically, Midwest, East Coast, call coh-
chleah. West Coast, call caw-cochlea, thing. snail-
shaped structure inner ear sound gets converted electrical signals
brain can understand. want just bring attention little hammer
little hammer really, really cool. means sound waves come
ears, happening right now, eardrum have,
like top drum. like membrane, can move back forth. not super
rigid moves little hammer. hammer goes, doom-doom-doom-
doom hits coil-shaped thing calling cochlea. Now cochlea,
one end, rigid other. one part can move really easily
part doesn't move easily. turns important decoding
separating sounds low frequency like Costello's snoring sounds
high frequency, like shriek shrill. within little coil thing,
call cochlea, tiny little called hair cells. Now look like
hairs, not related hairs head elsewhere body.
just shaped like hair, call hair cells. hair cells, move,
send signals brain particular sound environment. hair
cells don't move, means particular sound not environment. just give
mental picture this, sound waves coming in, stuff
there, making noises like voice; changing patterns air around very,
subtle ways; information getting funneled ears pinnas
shaped particular way. eardrum moves little hammer
hammer bangs little snail-shaped thing. snail-shaped thing,
one end, rigid, doesn't want move end, flexible,
can separate high-frequency low-frequency sounds. fact thing
inner ear call cochlea coiled, actually really important
understand along length, varies rigid flexible is, already
mentioned base, rigid hair cells,
move, will make high-frequency sounds, top, called apex,
flexible like bass drum. basically happens sound waves
come ears one end thing call cochlea, top,
essentially encoding responding sounds like, doom-doom-doom-


doom. Whereas, bottom, responds high-frequency sounds like cymbal,
[clanging]. everywhere between, frequencies, medium
frequencies. Now stagger mind. doesn't already, should.
means everything happening around us, whether not music
voices crying screaming screaming delight small children
excited, 'cause playing 'cause get cake; broken
component parts brain making sense means.
things talking about, like pinna ears little hammer
cochlea, purely mechanical. no mind own. just breaking
things high frequencies, medium frequencies low frequencies.
don't understand sound frequency, really simple understand, just imagine ripples
pond. ripples close together, high frequency; occur
high frequency. ripples apart, low frequency. obviously,
medium frequency between. just like can waves water, can
waves air. really works. Now familiar light
how, take prism put front light, will split light different
wavelengths, different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera. like Pink Floyd "Dark
Side Moon" album, think, prism converting white light
colors, wavelengths contained white light. cochlea, essentially,
acts prism. takes sound environment splits sounds
different frequencies. can think cochlea ear, sort like prism
brain takes

00:21:56 Hearing Brain (Areas)

information puts back together makes sense it. hair cells
two cochlea, two ears, also two cochlea, send
little wires, call axons convey patterns activity brain.
number different stations within brain information arrives
gets parts brain, consciously aware.
asked names nomenclature, give you.
don't want lot detailed names, can just ignore say. But,
basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump
cells. spiral ganglion bunch neurons information goes off
called cochlear nuclei brainstem. Brainstem near neck,
structure really cool name called superior olive,
one side brain. bring lab show
superior olives brain anyone else's brain, look like little olives, even
little divot me, looks like pimiento, just call
superior olive. neurons superior olive, send information
called inferior colliculus, called inferior sits structure
called superior colliculus. information goes called
medial geniculate nucleus. neocortex make sense
all. Now don't remember that, know lot
stations auditory information processed gets conscious
detection.

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front
you. Disruptions auditory hearing visual matching actually basis
called ventriloquism effect, talk minutes
depth. ventriloquism effect can basically described simple terms
essentially think sound coming location not actually coming
from. talk moment like realize one
stations, deep brainstem responsible helping identify sounds
coming process called interaural time differences. sounds
fancy, really, way know things coming from, direction car


boss person coming sound lands one ear

calculate difference time arrival sound waves right versus
left ear. arrive time, assume thing making noise right
front you. off right, assume right. sound
arrives first left ear, assume, quite correctly, thing coming toward

outside world determining information coming from. Now,
happens very, fast subconscious now know people really
want hear something, make cup around ear. essentially make
ear fennec fox type ear. ever seen cute little fennec fox
things, big spiky ears, look like French bulldog, although fox
version version French bulldog. big, tall ears, excellent sound
localization. people lean ear, hand like this,
listening this, just cupping hand ear, giving bigger pinna.
left side, can side. really want hear something,
sides. isn't just gesturing, actually serves mechanical role.
actually, want hear things coming much greater
degree accuracy, can actually help capturing sound waves
funneling better. really remarkable, whole system. got two
ears differences timing things arrive two ears,
well differences frequencies certain things sound, say
differences frequencies

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look
ears, ears remarkably similar ears, rather ears remarkably
similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates
similar ears; ears, similar ears. interested ear
movements mean things ear movements
correlate aspects biology, nice paper, actually, scientific
paper. author's last name Code, C-O-D-E, published 1995. give
reference that. review article discusses sex differences ear
movement control, well relationship ear movements eye
movements. pretty accessible paper. one think
interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:33:00 Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role Hormones, Sexual Orientation

biology. guessing not heard this.
describe called otoacoustic emissions. otoacoustic emissions, name
suggests, sounds ears make. Believe not, 70% people make noises
ears, don't actually detect them. Like said, never heard this.
Okay, not mean. mean 70% people's ears
making noise cast ear. otoacoustic emissions, actually, can
detected microphones. Sometimes can detected people
room good hearing. Now, turns women or,
technical here, females report heterosexual, higher
frequency, not frequency sound, higher frequency otoacoustic emissions
men report heterosexual. Women report
homosexual bisexual, make fewer otoacoustic emissions heterosexual women.
data come Dennis McFadden's lab University Texas,
Austin. actually discovered these, called sexual dimorphisms


differences based sexual orientation without looking them. studying
hearing. auditory scientist people coming laboratory
detecting otoacoustic emissions. started notice group
differences otoacoustic emissions. started asking people sex
sexual orientation. differences fell data, say.
interesting otoacoustic emissions not something associate
sex sexual dimorphism. data really underscore is, first all, lot us
making noises ears, us others. exposure
certain combinations hormones development likely shaping way

hormones developing brain body.

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully
asleep. can sort ascend staircase findings here, speak.
find evidence alpha waves, eight 13 hertz can increase alertness
moderate level. great state brain recall existing information.
beta waves, 15 20 hertz great bringing brain focus states
sustained thought incorporating new information especially gamma waves,
highest frequency, frequent ripples sound, speak, 32 100 hertz
learning problem-solving. Now, matches, say, maps onto
said learning really nicely, need highly alert
state order bring new information in, order access state mind
can tell brain brain telling itself, okay, need learn this.
stress unfortunate circumstances memorable brain gets
really high alert system. Here, talking use binaural beats order


increase level alertness level calmness. Now important
underscore not something fundamentally important
binaural beats. yet another way bringing brain states deep
relaxation low frequency sound highly alert states focused learning
high-frequency sound. effective review little bit data
detail, effective, not uniquely special learning. just
can help people bring brain state allows learn
better. lot studies allowed us arrive, say allowed
field arrive parameters slow, slow, low frequency waves going bring
relaxed states, high frequency waves alert states. good
evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense

can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend
number different factors. can't tell turn level two volume controller.
just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

00:13:53 Perceive Sounds

want get access meditations free go
headspace.com/specialoffer. Can hear me? Can hear me? Okay, well,
can hear me, amazing means voice causing little tiny
changes airwaves wherever happen be. ears whatever's
contained ears brain can take sound waves make sense
them. absolutely fantastic staggering feat biology yet
understand lot process works. going teach now
simple terms next minutes. call ears technical name.
technical name oracles, often called pinna, pinnas, P-I-N-N-
A, pinna. pinnas ears, outer part made cartilage stuff
arranged can capture sound best way head size. going
talk ear size also, 'cause turns ears change size across
lifespan big ears rather fast ears changing size
pretty good indication fast aging. get minutes,
want talk things call ears stuff contained
within allow us hear. shape ears
amplifies high-frequency sounds. High frequency sounds, name suggests,
squeakier stuff. low frequency sound, Costello snoring background low
frequency sound high frequency sound, okay? low frequency sounds
high frequency sounds everything between. Now sound waves get captured
ears. sound waves, don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves, literally just fluctuations shifts way air
moving toward ear space. way water can waves,
air can waves. reverberation air. come ears
called eardrum. inside eardrum, little
bony thing shaped like little hammer. attached eardrum, can
move back forth like drum, little membrane, got hammer attached
it. hammer three parts. want know, three
parts called malleus, incus stapes. basically, can just think
hammer. got eardrum hammer. hammer


hammer something. hammers little coiled piece tissue
call cochlea, sometimes called cochlea, depending somebody
lives country. So, typically, Midwest, East Coast, call coh-
chleah. West Coast, call caw-cochlea, thing. snail-
shaped structure inner ear sound gets converted electrical signals
brain can understand. want just bring attention little hammer
little hammer really, really cool. means sound waves come
ears, happening right now, eardrum have,
like top drum. like membrane, can move back forth. not super
rigid moves little hammer. hammer goes, doom-doom-doom-
doom hits coil-shaped thing calling cochlea. Now cochlea,
one end, rigid other. one part can move really easily
part doesn't move easily. turns important decoding
separating sounds low frequency like Costello's snoring sounds
high frequency, like shriek shrill. within little coil thing,
call cochlea, tiny little called hair cells. Now look like
hairs, not related hairs head elsewhere body.
just shaped like hair, call hair cells. hair cells, move,
send signals brain particular sound environment. hair
cells don't move, means particular sound not environment. just give
mental picture this, sound waves coming in, stuff
there, making noises like voice; changing patterns air around very,
subtle ways; information getting funneled ears pinnas
shaped particular way. eardrum moves little hammer
hammer bangs little snail-shaped thing. snail-shaped thing,
one end, rigid, doesn't want move end, flexible,
can separate high-frequency low-frequency sounds. fact thing
inner ear call cochlea coiled, actually really important
understand along length, varies rigid flexible is, already
mentioned base, rigid hair cells,
move, will make high-frequency sounds, top, called apex,
flexible like bass drum. basically happens sound waves
come ears one end thing call cochlea, top,
essentially encoding responding sounds like, doom-doom-doom-


doom. Whereas, bottom, responds high-frequency sounds like cymbal,
[clanging]. everywhere between, frequencies, medium
frequencies. Now stagger mind. doesn't already, should.
means everything happening around us, whether not music
voices crying screaming screaming delight small children
excited, 'cause playing 'cause get cake; broken
component parts brain making sense means.
things talking about, like pinna ears little hammer
cochlea, purely mechanical. no mind own. just breaking
things high frequencies, medium frequencies low frequencies.
don't understand sound frequency, really simple understand, just imagine ripples
pond. ripples close together, high frequency; occur
high frequency. ripples apart, low frequency. obviously,
medium frequency between. just like can waves water, can
waves air. really works. Now familiar light
how, take prism put front light, will split light different
wavelengths, different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera. like Pink Floyd "Dark
Side Moon" album, think, prism converting white light
colors, wavelengths contained white light. cochlea, essentially,
acts prism. takes sound environment splits sounds
different frequencies. can think cochlea ear, sort like prism
brain takes

00:21:56 Hearing Brain (Areas)

information puts back together makes sense it. hair cells
two cochlea, two ears, also two cochlea, send
little wires, call axons convey patterns activity brain.
number different stations within brain information arrives
gets parts brain, consciously aware.
asked names nomenclature, give you.
don't want lot detailed names, can just ignore say. But,
basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump
cells. spiral ganglion bunch neurons information goes off
called cochlear nuclei brainstem. Brainstem near neck,
structure really cool name called superior olive,
one side brain. bring lab show
superior olives brain anyone else's brain, look like little olives, even
little divot me, looks like pimiento, just call
superior olive. neurons superior olive, send information
called inferior colliculus, called inferior sits structure
called superior colliculus. information goes called
medial geniculate nucleus. neocortex make sense
all. Now don't remember that, know lot
stations auditory information processed gets conscious
detection.

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front
you. Disruptions auditory hearing visual matching actually basis
called ventriloquism effect, talk minutes
depth. ventriloquism effect can basically described simple terms
essentially think sound coming location not actually coming
from. talk moment like realize one
stations, deep brainstem responsible helping identify sounds
coming process called interaural time differences. sounds
fancy, really, way know things coming from, direction car


boss person coming sound lands one ear
other. stations brain, meaning neurons brain
calculate difference time arrival sound waves right versus
left ear. arrive time, assume thing making noise right
front you. off right, assume right. sound
arrives first left ear, assume, quite correctly, thing coming toward
left ear. simple mechanical system level sound
localization. down? think it, sound coming
going land right ear left ear time. sound
going land right ear left ear time. way
know things terms called elevation,
plane frequencies. shape ears actually modifies
sound depending whether not coming straight you, floor
high above. already level ears, taking information
outside world determining information coming from. Now,
happens very, fast subconscious now know people really
want hear something, make cup around ear. essentially make
ear fennec fox type ear. ever seen cute little fennec fox
things, big spiky ears, look like French bulldog, although fox
version version French bulldog. big, tall ears, excellent sound
localization. people lean ear, hand like this,
listening this, just cupping hand ear, giving bigger pinna.
left side, can side. really want hear something,
sides. isn't just gesturing, actually serves mechanical role.
actually, want hear things coming much greater
degree accuracy, can actually help capturing sound waves
funneling better. really remarkable, whole system. got two
ears differences timing things arrive two ears,
well differences frequencies certain things sound, say
differences frequencies

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look
ears, ears remarkably similar ears, rather ears remarkably
similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates
similar ears; ears, similar ears. interested ear
movements mean things ear movements
correlate aspects biology, nice paper, actually, scientific
paper. author's last name Code, C-O-D-E, published 1995. give
reference that. review article discusses sex differences ear
movement control, well relationship ear movements eye
movements. pretty accessible paper. one think
interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:33:00 Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role Hormones, Sexual Orientation

biology. guessing not heard this.
describe called otoacoustic emissions. otoacoustic emissions, name
suggests, sounds ears make. Believe not, 70% people make noises
ears, don't actually detect them. Like said, never heard this.
Okay, not mean. mean 70% people's ears
making noise cast ear. otoacoustic emissions, actually, can
detected microphones. Sometimes can detected people
room good hearing. Now, turns women or,
technical here, females report heterosexual, higher
frequency, not frequency sound, higher frequency otoacoustic emissions
men report heterosexual. Women report
homosexual bisexual, make fewer otoacoustic emissions heterosexual women.
data come Dennis McFadden's lab University Texas,
Austin. actually discovered these, called sexual dimorphisms


differences based sexual orientation without looking them. studying
hearing. auditory scientist people coming laboratory
detecting otoacoustic emissions. started notice group
differences otoacoustic emissions. started asking people sex
sexual orientation. differences fell data, say.
interesting otoacoustic emissions not something associate
sex sexual dimorphism. data really underscore is, first all, lot us
making noises ears, us others. exposure
certain combinations hormones development likely shaping way

develop functions throughout lifespan. episode
hormones sexual development, gets much deeper effects
hormones developing brain body.

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully
asleep. can sort ascend staircase findings here, speak.
find evidence alpha waves, eight 13 hertz can increase alertness
moderate level. great state brain recall existing information.
beta waves, 15 20 hertz great bringing brain focus states
sustained thought incorporating new information especially gamma waves,
highest frequency, frequent ripples sound, speak, 32 100 hertz
learning problem-solving. Now, matches, say, maps onto
said learning really nicely, need highly alert
state order bring new information in, order access state mind
can tell brain brain telling itself, okay, need learn this.
stress unfortunate circumstances memorable brain gets
really high alert system. Here, talking use binaural beats order


increase level alertness level calmness. Now important
underscore not something fundamentally important
binaural beats. yet another way bringing brain states deep
relaxation low frequency sound highly alert states focused learning
high-frequency sound. effective review little bit data
detail, effective, not uniquely special learning. just
can help people bring brain state allows learn
better. lot studies allowed us arrive, say allowed
field arrive parameters slow, slow, low frequency waves going bring
relaxed states, high frequency waves alert states. good
evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia

chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense

can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused

appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend

just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker

put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions
agree mine folks consulted not separate matter. don't
know, cause don't know them, something felt important enough cue
to, especially since highlighted, excuse me, opposite effect true
adulthood. auditory system formed, established tonotopic
maps, presence background white noise not problem all.
fact, shouldn't problem also not attending it. idea


playing low enough volume forget background
supporting learning bringing brain heightened state alertness and,
especially, heightened state dopamine, dopaminergic activation brain,

01:03:25 Remembering Information, Cocktail Party Effect

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.
lot information, least, me. way want listen
going go road. See, already forgot. going go left
just going program instead just hearing word left, going think L
front left T. going left, okay. coding specific


words. hijacks naturally-occurring attention mechanisms
auditory system likes use. little bit data auditory encoding,
kind thing can beneficial. lot data attention auditory coding
beneficial. little bit data showing deliberately encoding auditory
information way, meaning trying learn auditory information way can
beneficial can accelerate learning. features describing
here, map onto work Mike Merzenich others
designed try overcome things like stutter treat various forms

01:12:55 Learn Information Hear

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced
phenomenon someone talk see mouth moving like,
yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought
neuroplasticity occur developing brain, work Recanzone
Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening
information, work Recanzone Merzenich work others addition
former student former post-doc, don't know which, Michael Kilgard now
got lab Texas others shown cuing attention
particular features speech, particular components speech, way
increases level attention overall allows us capture information
overall. don't want abstract all. means
listening, don't listen every word. already listening every word.

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize
step off curb driving car pull side
ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies
around sending clicks, [Andrew clicks tongue] think best bat sound
maybe [Andrew clicks tongue] clicking, actually propelling sound
particular frequency know. Now, whether not conscious it,
don't know. never asked them. ask them, don't think
answer. answer, couldn't answer language
understand. bat essentially flying around, sending sound waves, pinging
environment sound waves particular frequency depending
frequency sound waves come back, know getting closer
object away it. send sounds frequency of,

coming back even faster [roars] know getting closer
Doppler effect. comes back slowly, know nothing
front them. bat essentially navigating world creating auras
sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects

know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different

headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized

interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.

people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side

might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information

balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain

combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information

distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated

opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

inner ear call cochlea coiled, actually really important
understand along length, varies rigid flexible is, already
mentioned base, rigid hair cells,
move, will make high-frequency sounds, top, called apex,
flexible like bass drum. basically happens sound waves
come ears one end thing call cochlea, top,
essentially encoding responding sounds like, doom-doom-doom-


doom. Whereas, bottom, responds high-frequency sounds like cymbal,

basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things

tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front

now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic

is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get

haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher

called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies

intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory

many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract

takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody

instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side

might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving

stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body

ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point
horizon focus it. actually, not correct. true
cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make
suddenly feel nauseous. Sometimes cabs, particularly New York City,
lot occluders, lot stuff blocking field view. usually
little portal can see front front windshield,
stuff now, televisions back seat watching television cab
moving. linear acceleration, sometimes taking corners,
braking vestibular system adjust that. looking
phone book, even talking somebody, actually, starting feel
little nauseous just talking it. promise not going finish episode
vomiting end, least not here, can happen uncoupling
visual information motion, vestibular information. want

means everything happening around us, whether not music
voices crying screaming screaming delight small children
excited, 'cause playing 'cause get cake; broken

things talking about, like pinna ears little hammer
cochlea, purely mechanical. no mind own. just breaking
things high frequencies, medium frequencies low frequencies.
don't understand sound frequency, really simple understand, just imagine ripples

high frequency. ripples apart, low frequency. obviously,
medium frequency between. just like can waves water, can

how, take prism put front light, will split light different

acts prism. takes sound environment splits sounds

brain takes

00:21:56 Hearing Brain (Areas)

information puts back together makes sense it. hair cells
two cochlea, two ears, also two cochlea, send
little wires, call axons convey patterns activity brain.
number different stations within brain information arrives
gets parts brain, consciously aware.
asked names nomenclature, give you.
don't want lot detailed names, can just ignore say. But,
basically, cochlea send information called spiral ganglion. ganglion,
way, going learn neuroscience, just know anytime hear


ganglion, ganglion just clump, means bunch neurons. clump
cells. spiral ganglion bunch neurons information goes off
called cochlear nuclei brainstem. Brainstem near neck,
structure really cool name called superior olive,
one side brain. bring lab show
superior olives brain anyone else's brain, look like little olives, even
little divot me, looks like pimiento, just call
superior olive. neurons superior olive, send information
called inferior colliculus, called inferior sits structure
called superior colliculus. information goes called
medial geniculate nucleus. neocortex make sense
all. Now don't remember that, know lot
stations auditory information processed gets conscious
detection.

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front
you. Disruptions auditory hearing visual matching actually basis
called ventriloquism effect, talk minutes
depth. ventriloquism effect can basically described simple terms
essentially think sound coming location not actually coming
from. talk moment like realize one
stations, deep brainstem responsible helping identify sounds
coming process called interaural time differences. sounds
fancy, really, way know things coming from, direction car


boss person coming sound lands one ear
other. stations brain, meaning neurons brain
calculate difference time arrival sound waves right versus
left ear. arrive time, assume thing making noise right
front you. off right, assume right. sound
arrives first left ear, assume, quite correctly, thing coming toward
left ear. simple mechanical system level sound
localization. down? think it, sound coming
going land right ear left ear time. sound
going land right ear left ear time. way
know things terms called elevation,
plane frequencies. shape ears actually modifies
sound depending whether not coming straight you, floor
high above. already level ears, taking information
outside world determining information coming from. Now,
happens very, fast subconscious now know people really
want hear something, make cup around ear. essentially make
ear fennec fox type ear. ever seen cute little fennec fox
things, big spiky ears, look like French bulldog, although fox
version version French bulldog. big, tall ears, excellent sound
localization. people lean ear, hand like this,
listening this, just cupping hand ear, giving bigger pinna.
left side, can side. really want hear something,
sides. isn't just gesturing, actually serves mechanical role.
actually, want hear things coming much greater
degree accuracy, can actually help capturing sound waves
funneling better. really remarkable, whole system. got two
ears differences timing things arrive two ears,
well differences frequencies certain things sound, say
differences frequencies

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know

little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information

balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting

mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

00:23:48 Localizing Sounds

good reason that, important knowing
hearing, need know coming from. vital survival,
something, instance, falling toward us, know coming right side,
going hit us behind, know, instance, car coming us
left right. visual system can help that. auditory
visual system collaborate help us find locate position things
space. come no surprise. hear somebody talking off right,
tend turn right, not left. see somebody's mouth moving
front you, tend assume sound going come right front

essentially think sound coming location not actually coming

00:28:00 Ear Movement: Means

arrive ears, depending whether not thing right


front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look

similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates

interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:33:00 Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role Hormones, Sexual Orientation

biology. guessing not heard this.
describe called otoacoustic emissions. otoacoustic emissions, name
suggests, sounds ears make. Believe not, 70% people make noises
ears, don't actually detect them. Like said, never heard this.
Okay, not mean. mean 70% people's ears
making noise cast ear. otoacoustic emissions, actually, can
detected microphones. Sometimes can detected people
room good hearing. Now, turns women or,
technical here, females report heterosexual, higher
frequency, not frequency sound, higher frequency otoacoustic emissions
men report heterosexual. Women report
homosexual bisexual, make fewer otoacoustic emissions heterosexual women.
data come Dennis McFadden's lab University Texas,
Austin. actually discovered these, called sexual dimorphisms


differences based sexual orientation without looking them. studying
hearing. auditory scientist people coming laboratory
detecting otoacoustic emissions. started notice group
differences otoacoustic emissions. started asking people sex
sexual orientation. differences fell data, say.
interesting otoacoustic emissions not something associate

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully

evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low

future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted

not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer

60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna

People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears

technical here, females report heterosexual, higher

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully
asleep. can sort ascend staircase findings here, speak.
find evidence alpha waves, eight 13 hertz can increase alertness

evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense
motivation activate sense desire continue focusing learning.
can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend
number different factors. can't tell turn level two volume controller.
just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene

can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling

particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial

enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes

making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

front you, able make things space pretty well.
now probably starting realize two things side head
call ears lot hanging earrings aesthetic
purposes putting sunglasses top of. powerful devices allowing
us capture sound waves environment. Now question you,
is, can move ears? turns unlike animals, humans not
terrifically good moving ears. animals can move ears even
independently. Costello pretty good raising ears, two together,
can't really move ear separately. dogs can really well. fact,
sighthounds scenthounds exquisitely well. animals like deer
animals really acute hearing will put one ear
particular angle will tilt one will actually capture information
two distant sound-making organisms, hunters coming
animals coming them. good this. not good it.
60% people, thought, can move ears consciously without
touch ear. can that? Maybe try it. Ask someone look
see whether not can it. typical distances people can move
usually no two three millimeters. subtle can flap pinna
just using mental control? can, can't, try looking way right
way left. Obviously, driving car something
exercising, don't put danger right now. move eyes way
left, now way right, might feel little bit
contraction muscles control ear movement. Now want ask this: can
raise one eyebrow? not good it, can little bit, mostly like
cramping face one side. certainly can't raise right eyebrow. can
left eyebrow. Trying talk this, looks strange.
People can raise one eyebrow easily, almost always, can move ears
without touch them. controlled motor pathway.
seem small, statistically significant sex difference ability move one's
ears. Typically, men can women can, although plenty women can
move ears well. Now, think little strange off topic, not
really talking system brain, also
body musculature localizing things space. might find
interesting note one things share closely primates,


non-human primates, like macaque monkeys chimpanzees, look
ears, ears remarkably similar ears, rather ears remarkably
similar ears. eyes certain monkeys like macaque monkeys remarkably
similar human eyes. one reasons why, look baby macaque
monkey, unbelievably human element it. ears primates
similar ears; ears, similar ears. interested ear

paper. author's last name Code, C-O-D-E, published 1995. give
reference that. review article discusses sex differences ear

interested topic parse fairly easily. interesting
underlying biology theories humans so-called
vestigial ancient carry-over system moving ears. Now, ear movement
seems strange, next, want talk different feature hearing ears
even stranger, really interesting implications

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information
ears brain, eventually crossover, actually share information
sides brain, brain will average information come
sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding
bringing information in. may heard say before, alert
focused order learn. no passive learning unless little tiny infants.
can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully
asleep. can sort ascend staircase findings here, speak.
find evidence alpha waves, eight 13 hertz can increase alertness
moderate level. great state brain recall existing information.
beta waves, 15 20 hertz great bringing brain focus states
sustained thought incorporating new information especially gamma waves,
highest frequency, frequent ripples sound, speak, 32 100 hertz

said learning really nicely, need highly alert
state order bring new information in, order access state mind
can tell brain brain telling itself, okay, need learn this.
stress unfortunate circumstances memorable brain gets
really high alert system. Here, talking use binaural beats order


increase level alertness level calmness. Now important
underscore not something fundamentally important
binaural beats. yet another way bringing brain states deep
relaxation low frequency sound highly alert states focused learning
high-frequency sound. effective review little bit data
detail, effective, not uniquely special learning. just
can help people bring brain state allows learn
better. lot studies allowed us arrive, say allowed
field arrive parameters slow, slow, low frequency waves going bring
relaxed states, high frequency waves alert states. good
evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense
motivation activate sense desire continue focusing learning.
can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend

just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize

detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech

disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,

know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory

time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions
agree mine folks consulted not separate matter. don't
know, cause don't know them, something felt important enough cue

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking

big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take

can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax

scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps

far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et

quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low

people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white

They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-

provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases

many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating

takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just

accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly

can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy

simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low

shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying

auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

00:35:30 Binaural Beats: Work?

want check episode, will put link captions. now
want shift talking ways leverage hearing system, auditory system
can learn anything, not just auditory information, anything faster. get
lot questions so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, name suggests,
involve playing one frequency sound one ear different frequency sound
ear. might doomed, doon, doon, doon right ear, might
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding left ear. idea brain will take
two frequencies sound pathways bring information

sort intermediate frequency. rationale intermediate frequencies
place brain state better learning. say better learning,
want precise mean. mean focus encoding

can binaural beats make us focused? Can binaural beats allow us relax
anxious? know people, go dentist dentist offers
binaural beats drill teeth give root canals things sort,


probably causing anxiety just describing things right now.
available many dental practices. Binaural beats thought increase
creativity, least proposed increase creativity.
scientific data say binaural beats? number different apps
offer binaural beats. number different programs. think can also
even just find YouTube internet. typically, app
program particular outcome want: focused, creative, fall asleep,
less anxious, et cetera. scientific data say? believe not,
science binaural beats actually quite extensive precise. sound waves
measured, typically, hertz kilohertz. know many aren't familiar
thinking things hertz kilohertz. again, just remember waves
pond, ripples pond. close together, high-frequency.
far apart, low frequency. hear hertz,
essentially hearing higher frequency. many kilohertz
much higher frequency fewer hertz kilohertz. may
heard things delta waves theta waves alpha waves beta waves, et
cetera. Delta waves big, slow waves, low frequency. And, indeed,
quality evidence peer-reviewed studies not sponsored companies
make binaural beat apps tell us delta waves like one four hertz, low
frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help transition sleep
staying asleep. theta rhythms, like four eight hertz can bring
brain state subtle sleep meditation, deeply relaxed, not fully

good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three

Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working

seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense

can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend
number different factors. can't tell turn level two volume controller.
just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions
agree mine folks consulted not separate matter. don't
know, cause don't know them, something felt important enough cue
to, especially since highlighted, excuse me, opposite effect true
adulthood. auditory system formed, established tonotopic
maps, presence background white noise not problem all.
fact, shouldn't problem also not attending it. idea


playing low enough volume forget background
supporting learning bringing brain heightened state alertness and,
especially, heightened state dopamine, dopaminergic activation brain,

01:03:25 Remembering Information, Cocktail Party Effect

will make easier learn faster easier learn information. now
want talk auditory learning actually can get better learning
information hear, not just information see page motor skill
learning. lot reasons want this. lot classroom teaching,
whether not Zoom in-person auditory nature. Not everything
necessarily written us. also good get better listening told.
phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced

yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning

Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things

everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,

certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving

immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing

actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming

people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked

ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects

know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different

hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized

interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.

studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not

science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate

two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating

feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling

essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb

lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low

future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted

not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water

source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

underscore not something fundamentally important
binaural beats. yet another way bringing brain states deep
relaxation low frequency sound highly alert states focused learning
high-frequency sound. effective review little bit data
detail, effective, not uniquely special learning. just
can help people bring brain state allows learn
better. lot studies allowed us arrive, say allowed
field arrive parameters slow, slow, low frequency waves going bring
relaxed states, high frequency waves alert states. good
evidence anxiety reduction use binaural beats. interesting
anxiety reduction seems effective binaural beats bringing
brain delta, slow big waves like sleep, theta alpha states. link
couple studies although will probably link list really
segregates one one can see next one another.
good evidence binaural beats can used treat pain, chronic pain. three
studies peer-reviewed journals took look at, seem good
quality, not sponsored research, say, not paid specific company.
Binaural beats shown modestly improve cognition, attention, working
memory even creativity. real boost binaural beats appears
anxiety reduction pain reduction. people might find beneficial
oral surgeries, right? Believe not, people rather entire
root canal cavity drilled without Novocaine. sometimes
syringe phobia something sort just don't like numb
Novocaine, maybe underlying medical reason. think people
don't enjoy getting teeth drilled even Novocaine root canal.
seems binaural beats can effective environment. don't
go sort extreme environment benefit binaural beats. Binaural
beats either relatively inexpensive thing access, apps pretty
inexpensive. don't favorite binaural beats app recommend you. confess
use binaural beats years ago. shifted call NSDR, non-
sleep deep rest protocols favor those, many people like binaural beats say
benefit them, especially studying learning. think part
reason relates ability channel focus


background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal
Cognitive Neuroscience, 2014 paper, White Noise Improves Learning
Modulating Activity Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions Right Superior Temporal
Sulcus. Now don't expect know right spirit temporal sulcus is. don't
expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain
areas will active brain areas won't active. dopamine associated
motivation. Dopamine associated craving. Motivation associated
sorts different things, including movement study nicely shows
white noise can really enhance activity neurons called substantia
nigra VTA. substantia nigra VTA rich source dopamine
chockablock full dopamine neurons. area brain is,
perhaps, richest source dopamine neurons. actually can see brain
region microscope take slice brain look brain without
even staining proteins dopamine anything. two dark regions
bottom brain. reason called substantia nigra, nigra meaning dark
dopamine neurons actually make something makes neurons
dark. got two regions there, contain dopamine can
release dopamine and, essentially, activate brain regions activate sense
motivation activate sense desire continue focusing learning.
can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,
highly motivated fear desire. interesting
appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend
number different factors. can't tell turn level two volume controller.
just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not
room. now might seem like kind duh, actually really amazing,
right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast
headphones, different listening something room
sounds, sound waves, especially use noise-


cancellation headphones. going use white noise enhance studying
learning kind, also skill-learning, motor skill-learning
exercising, suggestion using headphones, keep quite low.
effect midbrain dopamine neurons background effect raising
baseline dopamine release. way dopamine neurons fires, always
firing; firing right now, mine, something exciting happens, fire
lot. something disappointing happens, firing, release dopamine
goes baseline. talking raising overall levels
attention motivation, translate better learning just tickling
neurons little bit, raising baseline firing. not turning white noise
point feeling amazing. isn't like turning favorite song.
actually opposite. getting baseline just bit. recommend
turning volume just bit can focus entirely task
trying do. And, course, turned white noise attention might drift
moment. loud? soft? can disappear work,
speak, attention can disappear work, probably sufficiently
quiet. say, well, like really loud music just blast
music, forget music. don't suggest blasting music. coming
somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't
see them. kind nice, not like the, younger, like
didn't want dork go concert earplugs, turns
dorks smarter everybody else, not ones craning
neck try hear trivial things age 30 'cause blew


hearing. working loud environment expose loud
environment, really want avoid big inflections sound that. loud
environment plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
high-frequency intense sound, call two-hit model, also true
concussion, can take stimulus normally threshold
injury, add another stimulus time, threshold
injury. then, suddenly, killed neurons. don't want make people
paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear
music thing. again, not hearing cop. not job,
somebody lost high-frequency hearing, can tell not
pleasure. old argument helps not hear listen people
don't want listen to,

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions
agree mine folks consulted not separate matter. don't
know, cause don't know them, something felt important enough cue
to, especially since highlighted, excuse me, opposite effect true
adulthood. auditory system formed, established tonotopic
maps, presence background white noise not problem all.
fact, shouldn't problem also not attending it. idea


playing low enough volume forget background

especially, heightened state dopamine, dopaminergic activation brain,

01:03:25 Remembering Information, Cocktail Party Effect

will make easier learn faster easier learn information. now

whether not Zoom in-person auditory nature. Not everything
necessarily written us. also good get better listening told.
phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.
lot information, least, me. way want listen
going go road. See, already forgot. going go left
just going program instead just hearing word left, going think L
front left T. going left, okay. coding specific


words. hijacks naturally-occurring attention mechanisms
auditory system likes use. little bit data auditory encoding,
kind thing can beneficial. lot data attention auditory coding
beneficial. little bit data showing deliberately encoding auditory

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense

something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked

tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good

tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side

might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving

heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain

ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like

combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information

distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated

opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting

mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

background noise. something also get asked lot. better listen
music background noise studying better complete
silence? Well, actually quite good literature well, not much
relates binaural beats, rather whether not people listening music, so-
called white noise, brown noise; believe not, white noise brown
noise, even pink noise impacts brain states

00:43:54 White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine

allow us learn information better not. now like talk white noise
want clear white noise shown really enhance brain
states learning certain individuals, particular, adults. white noise actually
can detrimental effect auditory learning maybe even development
auditory system young children particular infants. first like talk
beneficial effects white noise learning. really excellent
studies this. first one like just highlight one entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance Auditory Working Memory Task, fMRI
Study. study explored whether not learning enhanced
playing white noise background. strength study looked
underlying neural circuitry activation neural circuitry
people learning task. it, essentially, illustrates white
noise, provided white noise low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, not quiet can't hear it, not super loud either, actually
enhance learning significant degree. shown now huge
number different types learning. terrific article well somewhat
obscure journal, least, obscure me, is: Effects Noise Exposure
Cognitive Performance Brain Activity Patterns. study involving 54 subjects.
They, basically, evaluated mental workload attention different levels
noise exposure, background noise different, essentially, loudness noise.
reason like study looked different levels noise types
noise, varied number different things, opposed just two-
condition, either white noise no white noise type thing. found, again,
provided white noise not extremely loud, really enhance brain function
sake learning number different kinds information. Now great,


really doesn't get deeper guts mechanism. neuroscientist,
really want see not just something effect. always nice. always
nice see nice peer-reviewed study without kind commercial biases
effect, binaural beats can enhance learning listening white noise, not
loud can enhance learning. really want understand mechanism
understand mechanism, not start make sense, can also
imagine ways develop better tools protocols.
relieved find, say excited find study published Journal

expect know dopamine midbrain region is, like me,
probably took highlighted notice word dopaminergic. Dopamine
neuromodulator, meaning chemical released brain body,
mostly brain modulates, meaning controls likelihood certain brain

can't just snap fingers make release dopamine. actually
trigger dopamine release them. Now trigger can caused
excited something fact thing gave lot pleasure past,

appears white noise can raise call basal, baseline levels


dopamine released area, substantia nigra. now
starting get full picture particular sounds environment can
increase learning. that's, part, believe, release dopamine
substantia nigra. not trying shift away binaural beats,
thing, appear turning white noise low level, not loud. may
say, "Well, loud?" tell moment, not loud can allow
learn better ways modulating brain chemistry. loud
soft white noise learn? Well, studies, seemed
white noise heard person, wasn't imperceptible them,
loud enough hear, not loud felt intrusive
irritating them. going differ person person people
different levels auditory sensitivity. going depend age, going depend

just not going work. Also, don't know far given speaker
room got earphones head got speakers room
coming computer. don't know things. going
adjust white noise place not interfering ability
focus, rather enhancing ability focus. think good rule thumb going
put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context

many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract

takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen

noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et

studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling

particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody

instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence

works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible

time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system

loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't

paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer
can go listening things lower volume, longer able hear

noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies

intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes

ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

outputs cerebellum strongly linked areas brain release
neuromodulators make us feel really good, particular, serotonin dopamine.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point
horizon focus it. actually, not correct. true
cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make
suddenly feel nauseous. Sometimes cabs, particularly New York City,
lot occluders, lot stuff blocking field view. usually
little portal can see front front windshield,
stuff now, televisions back seat watching television cab
moving. linear acceleration, sometimes taking corners,
braking vestibular system adjust that. looking
phone book, even talking somebody, actually, starting feel
little nauseous just talking it. promise not going finish episode
vomiting end, least not here, can happen uncoupling
visual information motion, vestibular information. want
coupled. lot people drive, can't passenger seat.

passenger, just getting jolted around person driving.
looking phone, even worse. looking occluder
two front seats, even worse. staring

and, hopefully, cab drivers people get sick cars Ubers. Let
visual system vestibular system work together. appropriate, get
linear acceleration, improve sense balance.

put probably lower third kind volume dial, opposed
upper third, really blasting.

00:51:00 Headphones

really blasting noise, frankly, not good, especially not good,
meaning especially bad headphones in. want mention something
headphones talk white noise developmental context
can dangerous there. put headphones ears, incredible
effect making sounds like come inside head, not

right? brain assumes sounds coming inside head,
opposed environment moment put headphones in.
listening audiobook maybe listening podcast

somebody really likes loud music. grew kind loud fast rules
mentality, don't know loud fast rules means, can't help you,
time place, perhaps, listen music loud but, especially,
headphones, can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. unfortunately,
hair cells talked earlier, central nervous system
neurons, not regenerate, not come back. Now along lines hearing
loss, just say best way blow hearing good, eliminate
hearing loud sounds super imposed loud environment. loud
environments can cause hearing loss time. work construction site,
clanging really loud, work sound board club something,
headed towards hearing loss unless protect hearing earplugs
headphones. Nowadays, ear plugs low profile, meaning can't

paranoid, want protect hearing. no fun lose hearing.
going use headphones feel like want crank way, just
remember can get lower volume, meaning longer

00:55:51 White Noise Development: Possibly Harmful

doesn't really work. just send text messages instead.
white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children
noise machines like sound waves things like that, help kids
sleep. look, think kids getting good sleep parents getting good sleep vital
physical mental health family health. certainly sympathize
needs. However, data indicate white noise development can
detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,
data published journal, Science, years ago, actually scientist
know quite well, name Edward Chang, medical doctor now,
neurosurgeon, actually chair neurosurgery UCSF runs laboratory
study auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, mentor
time, Mike Merzenich published paper showing young animals


animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.
neighboring points space off right, like two fingers off right
mapped neighboring points space brain. space right front
mapped different location brain, systematic, regular. not
random. not salt pepper. goes high low right center left.
auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high
frequency low frequency everything organized systematic
way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling
do, something perhaps consider avoiding. don't think
pediatricians going aware data, talk auditory
physiologists audiologist somebody studies auditory development, fairly
certain opinions that. Now, whether not opinions
agree mine folks consulted not separate matter. don't
know, cause don't know them, something felt important enough cue
to, especially since highlighted, excuse me, opposite effect true

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced
phenomenon someone talk see mouth moving like,
yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought

Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize

ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies

maybe [Andrew clicks tongue] clicking, actually propelling sound
particular frequency know. Now, whether not conscious it,
don't know. never asked them. ask them, don't think

sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects

healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized
study. not going read these. Melatonin: Can Stop ringing?
interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.
one studies anywhere 30 100 subjects, one case 102
subjects; genders list out, typically, listed sex, not gender
studies say sexes, nonetheless; age range anywhere 30
years old, way 65 plus. didn't see studies people younger 30.
three focused melatonin, not surprisingly, titles, looking range
dosages anywhere three milligrams per day, sort typical many


supplements melatonin, still much higher one manufacture endogenously
pineal gland, three milligrams studies duration
anywhere 30 days much longer cases, six months. four
studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report
science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible
health wellbeing. not telling anyone run start taking
melatonin tinnitus, seem can effects reducing

one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher

called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember

effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract

takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene

can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said

called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain

white noise hearing loss development? know lot people children

detrimental auditory system. don't want frighten parents played
white noise kids, doesn't mean auditory system speech
patterns going disrupted interpretation speech going
disrupted forever. data published journal, Science, Science
one three, APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, stringent journals,

animal models exposed white noise, [shushing] type noise
saying older person, say older, mean, somebody late
teens, early 20s older benefit listening low level
background sake learning, well, exposed young animals white
noise, actually disrupted maps auditory world within brain.
haven't talked maps yet, want take moment talk
explain effect might mean kids
exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher
level cognition planning, decision-making, et cetera, creativity there,
called tonotopic maps. tonotopic map? Well, remember
cochlea, coiled one end, responds high frequencies
end, responds low frequencies? Like piano, keys sound different
extend piano keys. organized systematic way. not
intermixed high frequencies low frequencies. organized systematic
way one end other. visual system in, called retinotopic map.

auditory system, called tonotopic maps, frequency, high

way. Now experience life time baby time die
not systematic. don't hear low frequencies one part room one part
day high frequencies another part room part day,
intermixed. remember, cochlea separates out. Just like
prism light separates different wavelengths light, cochlea separates
different frequencies. developing brain takes separated
frequencies learns relationship itself, meaning child outside
world. White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. frequencies
intermixed. just noise. Whereas speak, voice has, now getting
technical, called certain envelope, meaning low
frequencies slightly higher frequency. Like might voice higher, although
not good that. voice starts crack can make voice lower, although


not low Costello's snore. envelope, container. White noise
no container. like colors rainbow spread together, actually
get get white light white noise analogous white light. one
reasons hearing lot white noise development long periods time
can detrimental development auditory system tonotopic
maps don't form normally; least, don't experimental animals. Now, reason
raising many people know, particular, friends small children,
say, "I want use white noise machine sleep. okay baby
use white noise machine?" consulted various people, scientists this.
said, "Well, baby also hearing parent's voices hearing music
hearing dog bark. not thing hearing." However, every
single person consulted said, "But neuroplasticity sleep.
kid sleeping. don't know want expose child white
noise entire night, might degrade tonotopic map." might not destroy
it. might not eliminate it, make little less clear, like taking keys
piano taping together, right? still got highs lows
appropriate order everything between. take keys together,
don't get fidelity. don't get precision noise comes
piano. So, again, don't want scare anybody, say
position make choice either using white noise something similar, pink noise
just variation. got little bit certain frequency, just like pink light
little bit certain wavelength white light. position make
choices things, put young, especially young child's sleeping
environment, white noise might something consider avoiding. Again, not telling

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.

here, map onto work Mike Merzenich others
designed try overcome things like stutter treat various forms

01:12:55 Learn Information Hear

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced

yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought
neuroplasticity occur developing brain, work Recanzone
Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.

actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming

people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense

family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace

two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going

going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going

move head, slowly, little stones base hula

go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right

Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

exposed lot white noise early on. auditory information goes cortex,
these, essentially, outside portion brain responsible higher

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much

challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know

Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen

Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want

once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck

down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things

pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies

people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.

actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference

allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side

three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving

head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,

Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance

direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move

effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract

takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just

studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking

once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know

little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging

every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting

mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

phenomenon called cocktail party effect. Now, even never
cocktail party, experienced participated called cocktail party
effect. cocktail party effect environment rich sound,
many sound waves coming many different sources, many different things,
city, classroom, car contains people various conversations,
somehow need able attend specific components sound waves,
meaning need hear certain people not others. reason called
cocktail party effect meaning brain exquisitely good creating
cone auditory attention, narrow band attention can extract
information care wipe away erase rest. Now takes work,
takes attention. One reasons might come home loud gathering,
maybe stadium, sports event cocktail party, matter, feel just
exhausted listening conversations trying listen
conversations watching game people moving past hearing
noise, clinking glasses, et cetera, takes attentional effort brain uses
lot energy just rest, uses even energy paying
strong attention something, literally caloric energy burning things like glucose, et
cetera, even ketogenic, burning energy. cocktail party effect
studied extensively field neuroscience now know mechanistic
level, one accomplishes feat attending certain sounds, despite fact
bombarded sorts sounds. couple ways
this. First all, much visual system, can expand contract


visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.
lot information, least, me. way want listen
going go road. See, already forgot. going go left
just going program instead just hearing word left, going think L
front left T. going left, okay. coding specific


words. hijacks naturally-occurring attention mechanisms
auditory system likes use. little bit data auditory encoding,
kind thing can beneficial. lot data attention auditory coding
beneficial. little bit data showing deliberately encoding auditory

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced

yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought

Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize
step off curb driving car pull side
ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies

sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging

skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested

canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting

mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

visual field view, can go panoramic vision, see entire scene
dilating gaze, talked lot podcast elsewhere.
can, instance, keep head eyes stationary mostly stationary, don't
rigid it, can expand field view can see walls
ceiling floor, can see environment, panoramic view.
accomplish without try went horizon, instance,
can contract field view, can bring focus particular location,
call vergence point, directly front me. Now pointing camera directly
front me. can that, can expand contract visual field view. Well,
can expand contract auditory field view, speak, auditory window.
can try next time environment rich noise, meaning lots
different sounds. can just tune noise background chatter. try
not focus one particular sound get background chatter noise.
find actually relaxing comparison trying listen somebody
cocktail party shouting back forth. Now, very, interested
person, getting know better telling you, combination
things, motivated nonetheless, requires energy
effort attention. this? Well, actually quite simple or, least,
simple, essence, although underlying mechanisms complex. Here,
credit laboratory guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, University
Oregon essentially figured able accomplish extraction
particular sounds. can really hear one person small number people amidst
huge background chatter pay attention onset words, also
offset words. Now, way visualize background noise just like
bunch waves noise, literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low
frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. got game, people
shouting, people talking phone, crack ball, somebody
actually manages hit ball, announcer, et cetera, whatever paying
attention to, set cone auditory attention, tunnel auditory attention,
listening although don't realize it, listening onset offset
words. Now powerful couple reasons. First all, call
arms, speak, disengage auditory system don't need focus
attention something particular. somebody, coming home
work, long day trying make particular conversation


background noise, might consider just not conversation, just letting
auditory landscape broad, almost like panoramic vision. trying
learn extract sound information, notes music, scales
music, words spoken somebody else, maybe somebody telling
need say particular speech information need learn
particular topic, telling you, deliberately paying attention
onset offset words can beneficial exactly way
auditory system likes bring information. one common
phenomenon think experience go party meet somebody
new say hi, say, "Hi, Andrew." say, "Hi, Jeff,"
instance. "Great meet you." minute later, can't remember guy's name.
Now, don't care name is? No, somehow presence
auditory information interfered. not mind necessarily someplace else.
signal-to-noise say wasn't high enough. Somehow way said
way landed ears, really matters, comes
learning, just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. noise
high signal low combination those. next time
ask somebody's name, remember listen onset say offset.
paying attention j Jeff paying attention f
F, Jeff, excuse me. chances are, able remember name. Now,
don't know people super learners names naturally not. don't
access brains. don't think going give access brains
either. interesting way take natural biology auditory attention
learning apply scenarios trying remember either people's
names specific information. Now, acknowledge trying learn every word
sentence paying attention onset offset actually disruptive
learning process. specific attention, like asking
directions city somebody says, okay, say lost say, okay,
going go two blocks down, going turn left. going
see landmark right. going go third door left.
lot information, least, me. way want listen
going go road. See, already forgot. going go left
just going program instead just hearing word left, going think L
front left T. going left, okay. coding specific


words. hijacks naturally-occurring attention mechanisms
auditory system likes use. little bit data auditory encoding,
kind thing can beneficial. lot data attention auditory coding
beneficial. little bit data showing deliberately encoding auditory
information way, meaning trying learn auditory information way can
beneficial can accelerate learning. features describing
here, map onto work Mike Merzenich others
designed try overcome things like stutter treat various forms

01:12:55 Learn Information Hear

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced
phenomenon someone talk see mouth moving like,
yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought
neuroplasticity occur developing brain, work Recanzone
Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening
information, work Recanzone Merzenich work others addition
former student former post-doc, don't know which, Michael Kilgard now
got lab Texas others shown cuing attention
particular features speech, particular components speech, way
increases level attention overall allows us capture information
overall. don't want abstract all. means
listening, don't listen every word. already listening every word.
information coming ears. trying extract
particular things themes within content. maybe decide listening
going listen word tools, going listen
voice goes background, get decide decide listen not.
decide focus isn't necessarily important fact
focusing. hope clear. auditory system time
cocktail party effect. talking exporting certain elements

particular notes within music particular scales, can make even broader


particular motifs music particular sentences words particular phrases.
that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize
step off curb driving car pull side
ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies
around sending clicks, [Andrew clicks tongue] think best bat sound
maybe [Andrew clicks tongue] clicking, actually propelling sound
particular frequency know. Now, whether not conscious it,
don't know. never asked them. ask them, don't think
answer. answer, couldn't answer language
understand. bat essentially flying around, sending sound waves, pinging
environment sound waves particular frequency depending
frequency sound waves come back, know getting closer
object away it. send sounds frequency of,

coming back even faster [roars] know getting closer
Doppler effect. comes back slowly, know nothing
front them. bat essentially navigating world creating auras
sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome

though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side

might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving

stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain

ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting

combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information

distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know

want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want

that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize
step off curb driving car pull side
ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies

sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different

headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,

studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report

studies lasting one six months, one impressive number subjects,
978 subjects ranging age 18 way 65 forth show not
huge effects Ginkgo, quote, limited evidence suggests tinnitus
side effect something else, particular, cognitive decline, age-related tinnitus
might helped Ginkgo Boaboa. won't go details zinc studies,
seems zinc supplementation higher levels typical people's

tinnitus people took supplemented zinc. aren't lot
studies that. find one double-blinded study. lasted anywhere
one six months, 41 subjects, genders listed here, 45 64,

tinnitus sufferers there, may already aware this, may already
taking things no positive effects, meaning didn't help, maybe not.
hope you'll, least, consider these, talk doctor them. realize
tinnitus extremely disruptive. can't say empathize don't, place
experience, is, don't tinnitus, don't include


myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

outputs cerebellum strongly linked areas brain release
neuromodulators make us feel really good, particular, serotonin dopamine.
early emerging sub-field within neuroscience, lot called
non-motor outputs cerebellum profound influence, not just ability
learn balance better, also feel overall. exercisers
there, hope people getting regular healthy amounts exercise. talked
means previous episodes, least 150 minutes week
endurance work, strength training, minimum five sets per body part maintain

maintain healthy, strengthened bones, et cetera.
things like curls gym, squats gym, riding Peloton, even
outside running, getting forward acceleration, never actually getting

make feel nauseous. Many people love roller-coasters one
reasons love roller-coasters way get body,
even not generating movement, get body forward acceleration
going upside tilted side tracks go side side

people hate roller-coasters probably getting nauseous, just hearing
that. encourage people get modes acceleration tilted every
while, provided can safely. immensely powerful way build
skills realm balance. also, people, very, pleasing. feels
really good chemical relationship

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point
horizon focus it. actually, not correct. true
cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make
suddenly feel nauseous. Sometimes cabs, particularly New York City,
lot occluders, lot stuff blocking field view. usually
little portal can see front front windshield,
stuff now, televisions back seat watching television cab
moving. linear acceleration, sometimes taking corners,
braking vestibular system adjust that. looking
phone book, even talking somebody, actually, starting feel
little nauseous just talking it. promise not going finish episode
vomiting end, least not here, can happen uncoupling
visual information motion, vestibular information. want
coupled. lot people drive, can't passenger seat.
drive, also get called proprioceptive feedback. body
sending signals also vestibular system space.
passenger, just getting jolted around person driving.
looking phone, even worse. looking occluder
two front seats, even worse. staring
front windshield great don't want fixate. So, hopefully, spared people
and, hopefully, cab drivers people get sick cars Ubers. Let
visual system vestibular system work together. appropriate, get
linear acceleration, improve sense balance.

words. hijacks naturally-occurring attention mechanisms
auditory system likes use. little bit data auditory encoding,
kind thing can beneficial. lot data attention auditory coding
beneficial. little bit data showing deliberately encoding auditory
information way, meaning trying learn auditory information way can
beneficial can accelerate learning. features describing
here, map onto work Mike Merzenich others
designed try overcome things like stutter treat various forms

01:12:55 Learn Information Hear

auditory learning disorders. importantly, perhaps powerful
work Mike Merzenich done graduate student, Gregg
Recanzone showed that, using attentional system, can actually learn much
faster can actually activate neuroplasticity adult brain, something
challenging do. auditory system one main ways
can access neuroplasticity broadly. just want take couple minutes
describe work Recanzone Merzenich, absolutely fantastic
fascinating. subjects try learn auditory information, except
told pay attention particular frequencies. now know
frequencies so, essentially, high-pitched sounds low-pitched sounds.
found just passively listening bunch stuff not allow brain change
stuff remembered all. not surprise. experienced
phenomenon someone talk see mouth moving like,
yeah, really important, really important. listening. trying
listen. walk away think didn't get that. wonder
whether not them, maybe happening right now. wonder
whether not you, wonder whether not trouble learning
attention deficit. number different things.
Recanzone Merzenich discovered instruct subjects listen
particular cues within speech, within sounds, not can learn things
quickly, can remap tonotopic maps cortex referred
earlier. actually get changes neural architecture, neural circuitry
brain, can occur not rapidly, can occur adult brain,


prior work not thought amenable change. long thought
neuroplasticity occur developing brain, work Recanzone
Merzenich auditory system actually first really opened
everybody's eyes ears idea brain can change adulthood.
sort process work might apply it. trying
learn music, trying learn information going recite,
can decide highlight certain words certain frequencies sound certain scales
certain keys piano, focus certain learning bouts.
give example real time me, meaning happening right now. know
generally want say arrive here, even know specifically certain things
want make sure get across you, don't think every single word
going say precise order going say things.
actually disruptive wouldn't match normal patterns speech
probably think sounding rather robotic that. one way
can remember information write out, instance, something want
say, can highlight particular words, can underline those. listening
somebody telling us information, can decide just highlight particular
words said us write down. Now, course, listening
information, work Recanzone Merzenich work others addition
former student former post-doc, don't know which, Michael Kilgard now
got lab Texas others shown cuing attention
particular features speech, particular components speech, way
increases level attention overall allows us capture information

particular motifs music particular sentences words particular phrases.
that, extract

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice
ripples water extend duck goose fairly regularly spaced
directions. duck goose stationary. moving
down, not moving forward backward side. Now, duck goose
swim forward paddling little webbed feet surface,
immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially
rendition siren, don't know ambulance police what, passing
street, Doppler effect. Doppler effect one main ways
make direction things arriving speeds trajectories.
get good, young age, discerning direction things
arriving direction going pass us in. Doppler effect
probably saved life many, many times. way, just don't realize
step off curb driving car pull side
ambulance firetruck can go heard siren off distance,
pull away curb get back road part,
don't see longer, also don't hear sirens distance. Now,
animals bats exquisitely good navigating environments
according sound. Now, heard bats don't see. actually not true.
actually vision, just rely heavily auditory system.


way bats navigate dark way bats navigate using sound
Doppler. Now, don't simply listen whether not things coming
moving away pay attention Doppler like siren example
gave you. generate sounds. bat, flies
around sending clicks, [Andrew clicks tongue] think best bat sound
maybe [Andrew clicks tongue] clicking, actually propelling sound
particular frequency know. Now, whether not conscious it,
don't know. never asked them. ask them, don't think
answer. answer, couldn't answer language
understand. bat essentially flying around, sending sound waves, pinging
environment sound waves particular frequency depending
frequency sound waves come back, know getting closer
object away it. send sounds frequency of,
much slower actually occur, say one every half second, [whining]
coming back even faster [roars] know getting closer
Doppler effect. comes back slowly, know nothing
front them. bat essentially navigating world creating auras
sound bounce back various objects, trees, et cetera, buildings
people, kind eerie think about.

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized
study. not going read these. Melatonin: Can Stop ringing?
interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.
one studies anywhere 30 100 subjects, one case 102
subjects; genders list out, typically, listed sex, not gender
studies say sexes, nonetheless; age range anywhere 30
years old, way 65 plus. didn't see studies people younger 30.
three focused melatonin, not surprisingly, titles, looking range
dosages anywhere three milligrams per day, sort typical many


supplements melatonin, still much higher one manufacture endogenously
pineal gland, three milligrams studies duration
anywhere 30 days much longer cases, six months. four
studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report
science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible
health wellbeing. not telling anyone run start taking
melatonin tinnitus, seem can effects reducing
symptoms. Ginkgo Boaboa interesting compound. prescribed
recommended many, many things, studies, again, double-blinded
studies lasting one six months, one impressive number subjects,
978 subjects ranging age 18 way 65 forth show not
huge effects Ginkgo, quote, limited evidence suggests tinnitus
side effect something else, particular, cognitive decline, age-related tinnitus
might helped Ginkgo Boaboa. won't go details zinc studies,
seems zinc supplementation higher levels typical people's
intakes 50 milligrams per day, appear able reduce subjective symptoms
tinnitus people took supplemented zinc. aren't lot
studies that. find one double-blinded study. lasted anywhere
one six months, 41 subjects, genders listed here, 45 64,
saw decrease severity tinnitus symptoms 50 milligrams elemental zinc
supplementation. last not least magnesium study. Again,
single study. Phase II study looking fairly limited number subjects,
19 subjects taking 532 milligrams elemental magnesium. take
magnesium, magnesium elemental magnesium, always translated
bottle, associated lessening symptoms related tinnitus.
tinnitus sufferers there, may already aware this, may already
taking things no positive effects, meaning didn't help, maybe not.
hope you'll, least, consider these, talk doctor them. realize
tinnitus extremely disruptive. can't say empathize don't, place
experience, is, don't tinnitus, don't include


myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.

might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

outputs cerebellum strongly linked areas brain release

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice

immediately notice ripples water close front duck
goose closer together ones trailed it, behind.
essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized
study. not going read these. Melatonin: Can Stop ringing?
interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.
one studies anywhere 30 100 subjects, one case 102
subjects; genders list out, typically, listed sex, not gender
studies say sexes, nonetheless; age range anywhere 30
years old, way 65 plus. didn't see studies people younger 30.
three focused melatonin, not surprisingly, titles, looking range
dosages anywhere three milligrams per day, sort typical many


supplements melatonin, still much higher one manufacture endogenously
pineal gland, three milligrams studies duration
anywhere 30 days much longer cases, six months. four
studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report
science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible
health wellbeing. not telling anyone run start taking
melatonin tinnitus, seem can effects reducing
symptoms. Ginkgo Boaboa interesting compound. prescribed
recommended many, many things, studies, again, double-blinded
studies lasting one six months, one impressive number subjects,
978 subjects ranging age 18 way 65 forth show not
huge effects Ginkgo, quote, limited evidence suggests tinnitus
side effect something else, particular, cognitive decline, age-related tinnitus
might helped Ginkgo Boaboa. won't go details zinc studies,
seems zinc supplementation higher levels typical people's
intakes 50 milligrams per day, appear able reduce subjective symptoms
tinnitus people took supplemented zinc. aren't lot
studies that. find one double-blinded study. lasted anywhere
one six months, 41 subjects, genders listed here, 45 64,
saw decrease severity tinnitus symptoms 50 milligrams elemental zinc

tinnitus sufferers there, may already aware this, may already
taking things no positive effects, meaning didn't help, maybe not.
hope you'll, least, consider these, talk doctor them. realize
tinnitus extremely disruptive. can't say empathize don't, place
experience, is, don't tinnitus, don't include


myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body

ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

01:18:10 Doppler

information overall, even though not paying attention information
once. Now, like talk phenomenon experienced before,
called Doppler. Doppler effect way experience sound
thing making sound moving. simplest way explain
translate sound visual world again. ever seen duck
goose sitting pond lake bobbing down, notice

essentially happens sound well. Doppler effect, experience
sounds closer us higher frequency, ripples closer together,
sounds away lower frequency, especially moving past us.
ever, instance, heard siren distance, [humming] essentially

01:22:43 Tinnitus: Found Help?

yes, see you, experience sound, sense
using Doppler accomplish it. Now like talk ringing ears.
something get asked lot. speaking signal-to-noise, don't know
get asked lot, many people suffer ringing ears,
people suffer ringing ears suffer much
prone ask. sampling bias, don't know, asked
enough times experiences discomfort people expressed
ringing ears really motivated go deep literature.
ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized
study. not going read these. Melatonin: Can Stop ringing?
interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.
one studies anywhere 30 100 subjects, one case 102
subjects; genders list out, typically, listed sex, not gender
studies say sexes, nonetheless; age range anywhere 30
years old, way 65 plus. didn't see studies people younger 30.
three focused melatonin, not surprisingly, titles, looking range
dosages anywhere three milligrams per day, sort typical many


supplements melatonin, still much higher one manufacture endogenously
pineal gland, three milligrams studies duration
anywhere 30 days much longer cases, six months. four
studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report
science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible
health wellbeing. not telling anyone run start taking
melatonin tinnitus, seem can effects reducing
symptoms. Ginkgo Boaboa interesting compound. prescribed
recommended many, many things, studies, again, double-blinded
studies lasting one six months, one impressive number subjects,
978 subjects ranging age 18 way 65 forth show not
huge effects Ginkgo, quote, limited evidence suggests tinnitus
side effect something else, particular, cognitive decline, age-related tinnitus
might helped Ginkgo Boaboa. won't go details zinc studies,
seems zinc supplementation higher levels typical people's
intakes 50 milligrams per day, appear able reduce subjective symptoms
tinnitus people took supplemented zinc. aren't lot
studies that. find one double-blinded study. lasted anywhere
one six months, 41 subjects, genders listed here, 45 64,
saw decrease severity tinnitus symptoms 50 milligrams elemental zinc

tinnitus sufferers there, may already aware this, may already
taking things no positive effects, meaning didn't help, maybe not.
hope you'll, least, consider these, talk doctor them. realize
tinnitus extremely disruptive. can't say empathize don't, place
experience, is, don't tinnitus, don't include


myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body

ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural

ringing ears one experiences called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus,
tinnitus. tinnitus can vary intensity can vary according stress levels, can
vary across lifespan even time day. subject background effects
contextual effects. think know best maximize


healthy sleep. number episodes that. Essentially, first four episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast sleep get better sleep.
know try limit stress. episode stress
ways mitigate stress well. However, people, seems, suffering
tinnitus, stress lack sleep just can't explain presence
tinnitus. Tinnitus can caused disruption hair cells talked
earlier damage hair cells. another reason why, even good
hearing now want protect hearing really avoid putting
two-hit environments, environments lot background noise,
add another really loud auditory stimulus. also can happen different
times, mention. go concert listen loud music
headphones go concert, go loud work environment,
hair cells can still vulnerable. hair cells knocked out,
currently, don't technology put back. Although many groups,
including excellent groups Stanford elsewhere, too, course, working
ways replenish hair cells restore hearing. treatments
tinnitus involve taking certain substances. medications tinnitus.
non-prescription landscape, typically discuss podcast,
discuss taking anything, are, essentially, four compounds
quality peer-reviewed data, not appear overt commercial
bias, meaning nothing's reported papers funding particular company
melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc magnesium. Now talked
melatonin before. personally not fan melatonin sleep aid, four
studies, first one entitled: Effects Melatonin Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse me,
Sleep. Second one, Treatment Central Sensory Neural Tinnitus orally-
administered melatonin. title goes much longer, randomized
study. not going read these. Melatonin: Can Stop ringing?
interesting article, double-blinded study, Effects Melatonin Tinnitus.
one studies anywhere 30 100 subjects, one case 102
subjects; genders list out, typically, listed sex, not gender
studies say sexes, nonetheless; age range anywhere 30
years old, way 65 plus. didn't see studies people younger 30.
three focused melatonin, not surprisingly, titles, looking range
dosages anywhere three milligrams per day, sort typical many


supplements melatonin, still much higher one manufacture endogenously
pineal gland, three milligrams studies duration
anywhere 30 days much longer cases, six months. four
studies found modest yet still statistically significant effects taking melatonin mouth,
orally-administered melatonin reducing severity tinnitus.
compelling, least me. doesn't sound like cure. And, course, always, not
physician, scientist, don't prescribe anything. profess things, report
science. decide melatonin right tinnitus.
certainly, say protect myself, also protect you. responsible
health wellbeing. not telling anyone run start taking
melatonin tinnitus, seem can effects reducing

recommended many, many things, studies, again, double-blinded
studies lasting one six months, one impressive number subjects,
978 subjects ranging age 18 way 65 forth show not
huge effects Ginkgo, quote, limited evidence suggests tinnitus
side effect something else, particular, cognitive decline, age-related tinnitus
might helped Ginkgo Boaboa. won't go details zinc studies,
seems zinc supplementation higher levels typical people's
intakes 50 milligrams per day, appear able reduce subjective symptoms
tinnitus people took supplemented zinc. aren't lot
studies that. find one double-blinded study. lasted anywhere
one six months, 41 subjects, genders listed here, 45 64,
saw decrease severity tinnitus symptoms 50 milligrams elemental zinc
supplementation. last not least magnesium study. Again,
single study. Phase II study looking fairly limited number subjects,
19 subjects taking 532 milligrams elemental magnesium. take
magnesium, magnesium elemental magnesium, always translated
bottle, associated lessening symptoms related tinnitus.
tinnitus sufferers there, may already aware this, may already
taking things no positive effects, meaning didn't help, maybe not.
hope you'll, least, consider these, talk doctor them. realize
tinnitus extremely disruptive. can't say empathize don't, place
experience, is, don't tinnitus, don't include


myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

outputs cerebellum strongly linked areas brain release
neuromodulators make us feel really good, particular, serotonin dopamine.
early emerging sub-field within neuroscience, lot called

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

make feel nauseous. Many people love roller-coasters one
reasons love roller-coasters way get body,
even not generating movement, get body forward acceleration
going upside tilted side tracks go side side
tilt, et cetera, getting activation deeper brain nuclei trigger
release neuromodulators just make us feel really, really good. fact,
people get long arc, long duration buzz gone experiences.
people hate roller-coasters probably getting nauseous, just hearing
that. encourage people get modes acceleration tilted every

skills realm balance. also, people, very, pleasing. feels
really good chemical relationship

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point
horizon focus it. actually, not correct. true
cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make
suddenly feel nauseous. Sometimes cabs, particularly New York City,
lot occluders, lot stuff blocking field view. usually
little portal can see front front windshield,
stuff now, televisions back seat watching television cab
moving. linear acceleration, sometimes taking corners,
braking vestibular system adjust that. looking
phone book, even talking somebody, actually, starting feel
little nauseous just talking it. promise not going finish episode
vomiting end, least not here, can happen uncoupling
visual information motion, vestibular information. want
coupled. lot people drive, can't passenger seat.
drive, also get called proprioceptive feedback. body
sending signals also vestibular system space.
passenger, just getting jolted around person driving.
looking phone, even worse. looking occluder
two front seats, even worse. staring
front windshield great don't want fixate. So, hopefully, spared people
and, hopefully, cab drivers people get sick cars Ubers. Let
visual system vestibular system work together. appropriate, get
linear acceleration, improve sense balance.

circuits vestibular system. then, course, feel-good components
acceleration tilted getting head different orientations relative
gravity, well, explanation roller-coasters. people hate roller-coasters.
make feel nauseous. Many people love roller-coasters one
reasons love roller-coasters way get body,
even not generating movement, get body forward acceleration
going upside tilted side tracks go side side
tilt, et cetera, getting activation deeper brain nuclei trigger
release neuromodulators just make us feel really, really good. fact,
people get long arc, long duration buzz gone experiences.
people hate roller-coasters probably getting nauseous, just hearing
that. encourage people get modes acceleration tilted every
while, provided can safely. immensely powerful way build
skills realm balance. also, people, very, pleasing. feels
really good chemical relationship

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb
stationary, called dizzy. Now, feel like falling feel like
need get onto ground feel light-headed, light-
headed. And, oftentimes, language don't distinguish dizzy
lightheaded. Now lot ways dizziness lightheadedness can
occur. don't even want begin guess number different things
ways happen suffer
number them. But, oftentimes, people lightheaded, yes, low blood
sugar. also dehydrated. also low
electrolytes. talked previous episode, will talk
future episode. Many people little sodium system, salt,
feel lightheaded. family members who, years, thought disrupted
blood sugar. get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, feel like nauseous, et
cetera. simply addition little sea salt water remedied problem
entirely. don't think going remedy every issue lightheadedness
stretch, just addition salt, particular case, helped person.
not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point
horizon focus it. actually, not correct. true
cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make
suddenly feel nauseous. Sometimes cabs, particularly New York City,
lot occluders, lot stuff blocking field view. usually
little portal can see front front windshield,
stuff now, televisions back seat watching television cab
moving. linear acceleration, sometimes taking corners,
braking vestibular system adjust that. looking
phone book, even talking somebody, actually, starting feel
little nauseous just talking it. promise not going finish episode
vomiting end, least not here, can happen uncoupling
visual information motion, vestibular information. want
coupled. lot people drive, can't passenger seat.
drive, also get called proprioceptive feedback. body
sending signals also vestibular system space.
passenger, just getting jolted around person driving.
looking phone, even worse. looking occluder
two front seats, even worse. staring
front windshield great don't want fixate. So, hopefully, spared people
and, hopefully, cab drivers people get sick cars Ubers. Let
visual system vestibular system work together. appropriate, get
linear acceleration, improve sense balance.

myself, can imagine hearing sounds things aren't ringing
one's ears can disruptive think disruptive explains
people tinnitus reach often

01:30:40 Aging: Big Ears?

questions alleviate that. hope information useful you.
like now talk balance sense balance, controlled by,
believe not, ears things ears, well brain elements
spinal cord. that, want ask another question rather,
like ask ask question answer it, big
ears. turns ears grow entire life. early stage life, grow
slowly. age, grow quickly. may noticed
family members well 70s 80s, fortunate,
90s maybe even 100s, ears individuals get very,
big, relative previous ear sizes. turns biological age can
actually measured according ear size. Now take measurements
there's, believe not, formula scientific literature, know
ear circumference, distance around ear, ears, plural, presumably
two, people do, millimeters, going take circumference
ears millimeters. this? this? Maybe take
string put around ear, measure string. probably
going easier marching around ear somebody else's ear ruler
measuring millimeters. ear circumference, outside, don't go
divot anything. just going around going trace
closest fitting oval, assuming ears oval, closest fitting oval matches
ear circumference. Take number millimeters, subtract it... Oh, excuse me,
correctly. ears, add together, add numbers
together, divide two, get average two ears, get average ear
circumference, course, two ears. take number millimeters, subtract
88.1 whatever value is, multiply times 1.96 will tell
biological age. Now world accurate? age,
changes number different biological pathways. One pathways
pathways related collagen synthesis. not ears growing, noses


growing too, nose seems growing lot. again, sports
get nose broken, something don't recommend. always point out,
don't get nose like mine yoga, nonetheless, nose still growing
ears still growing. suspect get older, good fortune living
80s 90s, ears going continue grow. comparison
chronological age biological age something really deep interest
days work David Sinclair Harvard Medical School others. called
Horvath clocks people developed tapped epigenome
genome can give us insight biological age compares
chronological age. us know chronological age, know
born know relative now. can start make
little chart, like, rates ear growth. rates ear growth actually
correlate pretty well rates biological progression thing
call life. not something think often, just like DNA
epigenome, markers metabolic health hormone health relate
age, collagen synthesis. one places shows
two little goodies sides heads, ears. even
though little bit bizarre metric,

01:35:00 Balance: Semi-Circular Canals

makes perfect sense biological context. talk balance
get better balancing. reason talking balance get
better balancing episode hearing goodies going
allow ears. also brain, mostly
ears. recall beginning episode, two cochlea,
cochleas, one side head. little spiral snail-shaped
thing converts sound waves electrical signals rest brain can
understand. Right next those, called semicircular canals.
semicircular canals can best visualized thinking three hula hoops
marbles them. imagine hula hoop not filled marbles
way around, just got marbles base.
move hula hoop around, marbles move around, [shushing]. got
three one hula hoops marbles can move


around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
published 2015 called Effects Balance Training Balance Performance.
healthy adults. systematic review meta analysis. meta analysis
combine lot literature lot different papers extract really robust
less robust statistical effects. really nice paper well.


papers there, instance, comparison static balance role vision
elite athletes. essentially paper extracted information
just gave from. paper, others well, basically
distilled core components. core components move
vision around staying static, still balanced position like standing one leg,
something complicated somebody can complicated
movements. Unilateral movement seemed important, standing one leg
opposed both, trying generate tilt another way go
imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically activated compared
limb.

01:48:55 Accelerating Balance

way encourage cultivate build vestibular system
sense balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
going talk now. now, talking balance
static sense, like standing one leg instance, artificial
situation. Even though can train balance way, people want
enhance sense balance sport dance, endeavor, want
engage balance dynamic way, meaning moving lots different planes
movement, maybe even sometimes squatting low jumping landing
making trajectories different angles. that, need consider
vestibular system also cares acceleration. cares head position, cares
eye position eyes looking, also cares
direction moving fast. one best things can
enhance sense balance start bring together visual system,
semicircular canals inner ear call linear acceleration. move
forward space rigidly upright, vastly different situation leaning
side. One best ways cultivate better sense balance, literally, within
sense organs neurons biology brain get modes
accelerating forward, typically, forward also tilted respect gravity.
Now carve skateboard surf board snowboard.
taking corner bike able lean, safely, course, lean
turn head actually tilted respect earth. anytime


rigidly upright, aren't really exercising vestibular system imbalance.
see people gym these, one bouncy balls, Bocce balls
one guys roll park. Bouncy balls, balancing back
forth, will work small stabilizing muscles. talking getting
modes actually tilt body head respect earth.
mean respect Earth's gravitational pull. Now cerebellum
interesting structure not involved balance, also involved
skill-learning generating timing movements. fascinating structure
deserving entire episode several episodes own,
outputs cerebellum, meaning neurons cerebellum get inputs,
also send information out.

01:51:55 Self-Generated Forward Motion

outputs cerebellum strongly linked areas brain release
neuromodulators make us feel really good, particular, serotonin dopamine.
early emerging sub-field within neuroscience, lot called
non-motor outputs cerebellum profound influence, not just ability
learn balance better, also feel overall. exercisers
there, hope people getting regular healthy amounts exercise. talked
means previous episodes, least 150 minutes week
endurance work, strength training, minimum five sets per body part maintain
musculature even don't want grow muscles, want order
maintain healthy, strengthened bones, et cetera.
things like curls gym, squats gym, riding Peloton, even
outside running, getting forward acceleration, never actually getting
tilted, never actually getting tilted respect Earth's gravitational pull,
not really exercising getting nervous system. Activation
cerebellum way tilted head tilted body tilted
acceleration, typically forward acceleration, sometimes side side
profound positive effect sense mood wellbeing. talked
previous episode, can also enhance ability learn information period
generating tilts. acceleration. cerebellum
outputs areas brain release neuromodulators, like


serotonin dopamine. make us feel really good. think one
reasons why, growing up, friends, might've world
heavyweight champions laziness essentially everything, except wake
4:30 morning go surf. drive, get early go

cycling. modes exercise seem outsized effect wellbeing
ability translate vestibular balance achieve endeavors
ability balance things, don't mean psychological balance
necessarily. mean physical balance. don't think
coordinated good balance, getting modes acceleration
forward movement lateral movement getting tilted, even
slowly, beneficial, believe, scientific literature points fact
will beneficial cultivating better sense physical balance. can really build
circuits vestibular system. then, course, feel-good components
acceleration tilted getting head different orientations relative
gravity, well, explanation roller-coasters. people hate roller-coasters.
make feel nauseous. Many people love roller-coasters one
reasons love roller-coasters way get body,
even not generating movement, get body forward acceleration
going upside tilted side tracks go side side

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling

01:56:25 Dizzy versus Light-Headed



forward acceleration head tilt body tilt. Now, speaking feeling
nauseous, people suffer vertigo. people feel dizzy, people get
lightheaded. important question ask yourself, always, feeling quote-
unquote dizzy lightheaded, dizzy lightheaded? Now, not
going diagnose anything just no way can that.
essentially shouting tunnel. don't know going
every one ever feel world spinning, can focus
thumb, instance, rest world spinning thumb

not alone. Many people think low blood sugar, actually
lightheaded low electrolytes way salt carries water
system creates changes blood volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often
source lightheadedness can low blood sugar and, course, things
well.

01:58:38 Motion Sickness Solution

Now dizziness seasickness, taught need pick point

cabin boat lower deck can see things close


you, getting sloshed around, like boat going down, like so, think
getting little seasick, even describe it, focusing things close
can problematic. case, advice go deck get fresh air
look off horizon, part correct. focusing eyes particular
location horizon effectively like trying move slowly
before, trying move head slowly fixating one location.
eyes balance system designed move together. really,
want allow visual system track vestibular system.
sitting back Uber taxi phone can make

around. One hula hoops positioned vertically respect gravity.
basically parallel nose. sits like this, watching video, basically
upright. Another one hula hoops basically 90-degree angle
nose. basically parallel floor standing right now, seated.
one, kind tilted 45 degrees those. Now
system there? Well, marbles within one hula hoops can move
around, move around head moves particular way,
three planes three ways head can move. head can move
like nodding right now. called pitch, pitching forward pitching
back. nod, down, can shake head no, side side. called
yaw. pilots will familiar this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. roll,
tilting head side side, way cute puppy might look side
side somebody doesn't really understand believe saying,
might tilt head, common phenomenon. mean, nobody me,
other. pitch, yaw roll movements head
three major planes motion, say. one causes
marbles move one two various hula hoops. move head
nod, one hula hoops, literally, right now, marbles moving
back forth. aren't actually marbles way, little, kind like little
stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits roll back forth,
deflect little hairs, little hair cells aren't like hair cells use measuring
sound waves. not different, different them, not like hairs
heads, basically rolling past little hair cells causing
deflect deflect downward, neurons, hair cells neurons,
send information brain. move head like this, physical
movement little stones hula hoop referring it, deflect
hairs, send hairs, neurons, hair cells, send information off
brain. move head side side, different little stones move. roll
head, different stones move. exquisite system exists animals
jaw. fish jaw system, puppy system,
animal jaw so-called balance system, call vestibular
system. One important things know vestibular, balance
system works together visual system. say hear something off
left swing head left see is. two sources


information head relative body need know that. First
all, quickly move head side, little stones, referring them,
realize not actually stones, referring them, quickly, whoom,
activate hair cells one semicircular canal, send signal off brain
head just moved side like this, not went like pitched back
not tilted, just moved side. also visual information slid past field
view. didn't think it, just slid past field view.
two signals combine, eyes lock particular location. Now,
complicated, can actually uncouple things. easy do. can
right now. fact, like experiment not already
something else

01:40:35 Vestibular Experiment

requires attention. certainly, don't driving. going
sit going move head left slowly eyes open.
going move very, slowly. whole thing take five, six,
maybe even 10 seconds complete. Okay, just it. Now, going
quickly. like quickly well. Now slowly again.
probably noticed uncomfortable slowly, can
quickly without much discomfort all. just move head side. reason
move head, slowly, little stones base hula
hoop, don't get enough momentum move. actually not generating
signal brain head moving. notice eyes
go, boom, boom, boom, jumping step-by-step. Whereas move head
really quickly, signal gets off brain eyes just go boom, right
location want look at. moving body slowly actually disruptive
vestibular system. disruptive visual system. Now, ever
misfortune boat going big oscillations boat,
seasick, folks get seasick, can actually make certain people
seasick just hear it, big oscillations going down.
disruptive. talk nausea minute offset kind
nausea. get pretty seasick, ways can deal
incredible means purely physical system little stones rolling


around directing eyes go. can also just
looking up. just say, sitting chair, going look towards
ceiling eyes will just go there. eyes open look down.
Now try right really, really slowly. people even get motion sick this,
do, just stop. Okay, can also side, although
works best moving head side side nodding down.
uncoupling two mechanisms, pulling
apart, visual part vestibular part, just illustrate that, normally,
mechanisms inner ear tell eyes go, well,

01:43:15 Improve Sense Balance

eyes tell balance system, vestibular system, function. like
different experiment. not going right now, basically stand up.
get opportunity, can safely, wherever are, going stand
going look forward 10, 12 feet. Pick point wall can,
anywhere like, public, just anyway. Just tell
listening Huberman Lab Podcasts, someone's telling it. Anyway,
don't want it, don't it. But, basically, it. Stand one leg lift
leg. can bend knee, like just look off distance 10, 12
feet. can that, can stand one leg, now close eyes, chances
going suddenly feel scientists call postural sway. going start
swaying around lot. hard balance eyes closed. think
that, like, that? crazy. hard balance
eyes closed? Well, information visual world also feeds back onto
vestibular system. vestibular system informs vision tells
move eyes eyes positioning tell balance system,
vestibular system function. really cool way can learn
optimize balance. not going try learning balance
eyes closed. can can raise one leg can look short
distance, maybe off just distance thumb reach
arm front you. Although don't necessarily put thumb
front you. maybe just two feet front you. still balancing,
going step vision distance, distance


far can possibly see environment in. going
march back you. Now, literature shows kind balance training
incorporate visual system extending out, marching back
point direct visual focus, sends robust information
relationship visual world balance system. And, course,
balance system includes not just hula hoops, semicircular canals,
communicate cerebellum, so-called mini-brain, actually means mini-brain
back brain, combines visual information map body
surface. pattern training beneficial enhancing ability balance
ability balance is, part, activation particular postural muscles,
just much, perhaps even moreso, able adjust postural
muscles, excuse me, ability adjust postural muscles
experience changes visual world. one robust ways can
engage changes visual world movement.
people not trying balance place, right? not just trying stand like
statue one leg. think think balance
sake sport dynamic balance able break ourselves, lunging
one particular direction stop ourselves, is, move another direction
skateboarding surfing cycling number different things, gymnastics.
visual system primary input develop balance, can't
just visual system. recommending interested
cultivating sense balance, understand relationship semicircular
canals, understand driving eye movements driven eye
movements. reciprocal relationship. even just two three minutes day,
every while, even three times week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes, pick, want enhance balance, combine changes
visual environment static posture, standing one leg shifting
visual environment static visual view, looking one thing changing body
posture. two things, now know scientific literature, combine
order give enhanced sense balance. really nice paper
