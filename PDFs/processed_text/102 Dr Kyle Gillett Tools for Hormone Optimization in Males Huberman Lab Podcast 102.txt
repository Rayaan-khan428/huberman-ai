00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now, discussion Dr. Kyle
Gillett. Dr. Gillett, great back. KYLE GILLETT: Great back. Thank you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like begin question one
mysterious important phases life, puberty. long wondered whether
not quickly somebody goes puberty-- age-- long puberty
takes-- brief protracted puberty acquire so-called
secondary sexual characteristics, things like hair growth face males
changes bone, muscle density, growth, et cetera. middle
school high school, noticed people transitioned fast


people took long time acquire characteristics. Can learn anything
ourselves, hormones, maybe even long going live based
time enter puberty long takes us progress
puberty? guess also raises question, puberty ever truly end? KYLE
GILLETT: many takeaways puberty. actionable items
are, yes, can affect adult height also stature also body
composition. puberty time-- talking specifically males, think
time where, obesity child, potentially use time
change lifestyle habits reset things, bit easier. almost like
free injection testosterone metabolism drive effort life.
wide variation quickly puberty goes through. stages called Tanner
stages, don't necessarily need get into. enter puberty early,
can decrease adult height stature. ANDREW HUBERMAN: given
male enters puberty 13 versus male enters puberty 15, can say
guy entered puberty 13 going shorter guy entered
puberty 15, not quite straightforward? KYLE GILLETT: identical
twins individual entered puberty age 13 also finished puberty, went
way Tanner stages-- bone scan, believe usually
done left wrist, says yes, growth plates mostly closed, not
going grow couple inches height that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Just related question. growing up, thought, least people
say, resistance training-- particular, lifting heavy weights stunt one's growth.
true false? KYLE GILLETT: false talking just lifting
heavy weights. Dirty bulking certainly potential stunt one's growth two main
mechanisms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: define dirty bulking? KYLE GILLETT:
[CHUCKLES] dirty bulking eating excess calories not just acquire lean
metabolically active body mass get stronger, purposely acquiring body fat.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: purposely acquiring muscle fat overeating lifting
weights can stunt one's growth. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
two things. young child, can-- fat can become
leptin resistant can produce leptin, leptin can activate
hypothalamus, activates pituitary, releases gonadotropin,
basically just increase testosterone estrogen earlier otherwise have.
mechanism behind childhood obesity causes early puberty. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: Interesting. remember paper published Science Magazine--
believe focused mainly females, showing enough body fat
accumulates, hormone leptin secreted, triggers onset puberty.
KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given increase childhood
obesity observing now, seeing earlier onset puberty males
females? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, males females. Not get technical,
G protein-coupled receptor hypothalamus leptin directly binds it,
appear directly cause causatory not just correlation. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understand correctly, saying young guy-- say, 13, 14--
wants really bulk deliberately-- deliberately, excuse me-- overeats,
squats, deadlifts, bench presses really trying get big, will
get big, lateral dimension. effectively limiting total height
can shut long bone growth limbs. correct? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. growth long bones mostly related estradiol alpha receptor,
basically, one receptors estrogen, can secondary early puberty
also related body fat conversion testosterone
estrogen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can assume young male wants get
resistance training bodyweight exercises probably OK maybe even
weight training, kettlebells, et cetera, avoid so-called
dirty bulking-- trying deliberately gain weight-- age? puberty
over? KYLE GILLETT: say individual limit amount abnormal
body fat accumulation, dirty bulking, indefinitely throughout entire life. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: again, understand correctly, recommendation avoid
deliberate weight gain rapid weight gain not just allow individual reach
maximum height, also avoid laying lot body fat cells. Correct? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. balance is, going puberty,
able add lot lean body mass-- not just muscle mass, bone mass
mass well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: started lifting weights 16,
confess trained pretty heavy times. don't know whether not
taller now, started training, already reached
least close predicted height. can't say deliberately waited grown.
just happened stumbled weight room found liked age
16, point, already height now. case,
hearing laying lot excess body fat not good idea. somebody


grows chubby fat whatever reason-- reasons related eating patterns
family, maybe even genetic reasons. safe and/or wise young
person-- say somebody around age puberty, even younger,
late teens-- dieting actively trying lose body fat. safe? KYLE
GILLETT: supervision physician, certainly safe change body
composition. pediatric obesity medicine, often talking recomposition

00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty

renormalization growth curve compared peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great. Thank you. may sensed, started chronologically puberty,
know another puberty even precedes puberty
familiar with. Maybe-- want just briefly mention talking
started. puberty familiar with, think
people familiar with, acquisition deepening voice, growth muscle
bone, body hair, acquisition libido things like that. actually second
puberty go through. Maybe just mention us educate us
first puberty. think people will hearing first time. KYLE
GILLETT: first puberty everyone's life first three months life.
may notice baby acne first three months also have,
general, just changes related androgens estrogens, perhaps oilier skin,
even genitourinary-- genital growth first three months. mostly
due DHEA, adrenal hormone. second puberty, puberty
people know of, actually starts way well. called adrenarche,
adrenals kick in, guess, second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
standard age age range testicles descend males? KYLE
GILLETT: Usually birth. not uncommon one even two
undescended testes, risk testicular cancer, especially not
fixed early also heat damage teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank
coverage two puberties. early life. imagine listeners
probably still one the-- well, one puberty. ones first
puberty, obviously, aren't aware listening podcast, maybe it'll
embedded subconscious. listeners probably still puberty.
think everyone can remember back puberty, roughly first entered


puberty,

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now, discussion Dr. Kyle
Gillett. Dr. Gillett, great back. KYLE GILLETT: Great back. Thank you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like begin question one
mysterious important phases life, puberty. long wondered whether
not quickly somebody goes puberty-- age-- long puberty
takes-- brief protracted puberty acquire so-called
secondary sexual characteristics, things like hair growth face males
changes bone, muscle density, growth, et cetera. middle
school high school, noticed people transitioned fast


people took long time acquire characteristics. Can learn anything
ourselves, hormones, maybe even long going live based
time enter puberty long takes us progress
puberty? guess also raises question, puberty ever truly end? KYLE
GILLETT: many takeaways puberty. actionable items
are, yes, can affect adult height also stature also body
composition. puberty time-- talking specifically males, think
time where, obesity child, potentially use time
change lifestyle habits reset things, bit easier. almost like
free injection testosterone metabolism drive effort life.
wide variation quickly puberty goes through. stages called Tanner
stages, don't necessarily need get into. enter puberty early,
can decrease adult height stature. ANDREW HUBERMAN: given
male enters puberty 13 versus male enters puberty 15, can say
guy entered puberty 13 going shorter guy entered
puberty 15, not quite straightforward? KYLE GILLETT: identical
twins individual entered puberty age 13 also finished puberty, went
way Tanner stages-- bone scan, believe usually
done left wrist, says yes, growth plates mostly closed, not
going grow couple inches height that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Just related question. growing up, thought, least people
say, resistance training-- particular, lifting heavy weights stunt one's growth.
true false? KYLE GILLETT: false talking just lifting
heavy weights. Dirty bulking certainly potential stunt one's growth two main
mechanisms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: define dirty bulking? KYLE GILLETT:
[CHUCKLES] dirty bulking eating excess calories not just acquire lean
metabolically active body mass get stronger, purposely acquiring body fat.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: purposely acquiring muscle fat overeating lifting
weights can stunt one's growth. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
two things. young child, can-- fat can become
leptin resistant can produce leptin, leptin can activate
hypothalamus, activates pituitary, releases gonadotropin,
basically just increase testosterone estrogen earlier otherwise have.
mechanism behind childhood obesity causes early puberty. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: Interesting. remember paper published Science Magazine--
believe focused mainly females, showing enough body fat
accumulates, hormone leptin secreted, triggers onset puberty.
KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given increase childhood
obesity observing now, seeing earlier onset puberty males
females? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, males females. Not get technical,
G protein-coupled receptor hypothalamus leptin directly binds it,
appear directly cause causatory not just correlation. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understand correctly, saying young guy-- say, 13, 14--
wants really bulk deliberately-- deliberately, excuse me-- overeats,
squats, deadlifts, bench presses really trying get big, will
get big, lateral dimension. effectively limiting total height
can shut long bone growth limbs. correct? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. growth long bones mostly related estradiol alpha receptor,
basically, one receptors estrogen, can secondary early puberty
also related body fat conversion testosterone
estrogen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can assume young male wants get
resistance training bodyweight exercises probably OK maybe even
weight training, kettlebells, et cetera, avoid so-called
dirty bulking-- trying deliberately gain weight-- age? puberty
over? KYLE GILLETT: say individual limit amount abnormal
body fat accumulation, dirty bulking, indefinitely throughout entire life. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: again, understand correctly, recommendation avoid
deliberate weight gain rapid weight gain not just allow individual reach
maximum height, also avoid laying lot body fat cells. Correct? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. balance is, going puberty,
able add lot lean body mass-- not just muscle mass, bone mass
mass well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: started lifting weights 16,
confess trained pretty heavy times. don't know whether not
taller now, started training, already reached
least close predicted height. can't say deliberately waited grown.
just happened stumbled weight room found liked age
16, point, already height now. case,
hearing laying lot excess body fat not good idea. somebody


grows chubby fat whatever reason-- reasons related eating patterns
family, maybe even genetic reasons. safe and/or wise young
person-- say somebody around age puberty, even younger,
late teens-- dieting actively trying lose body fat. safe? KYLE
GILLETT: supervision physician, certainly safe change body
composition. pediatric obesity medicine, often talking recomposition

00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty

renormalization growth curve compared peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great. Thank you. may sensed, started chronologically puberty,
know another puberty even precedes puberty
familiar with. Maybe-- want just briefly mention talking
started. puberty familiar with, think
people familiar with, acquisition deepening voice, growth muscle
bone, body hair, acquisition libido things like that. actually second
puberty go through. Maybe just mention us educate us
first puberty. think people will hearing first time. KYLE
GILLETT: first puberty everyone's life first three months life.
may notice baby acne first three months also have,
general, just changes related androgens estrogens, perhaps oilier skin,
even genitourinary-- genital growth first three months. mostly
due DHEA, adrenal hormone. second puberty, puberty
people know of, actually starts way well. called adrenarche,
adrenals kick in, guess, second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
standard age age range testicles descend males? KYLE
GILLETT: Usually birth. not uncommon one even two
undescended testes, risk testicular cancer, especially not
fixed early also heat damage teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank
coverage two puberties. early life. imagine listeners
probably still one the-- well, one puberty. ones first
puberty, obviously, aren't aware listening podcast, maybe it'll
embedded subconscious. listeners probably still puberty.
think everyone can remember back puberty, roughly first entered


puberty,

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood

say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people

people took long time acquire characteristics. Can learn anything
ourselves, hormones, maybe even long going live based
time enter puberty long takes us progress
puberty? guess also raises question, puberty ever truly end? KYLE
GILLETT: many takeaways puberty. actionable items
are, yes, can affect adult height also stature also body
composition. puberty time-- talking specifically males, think
time where, obesity child, potentially use time
change lifestyle habits reset things, bit easier. almost like
free injection testosterone metabolism drive effort life.
wide variation quickly puberty goes through. stages called Tanner
stages, don't necessarily need get into. enter puberty early,
can decrease adult height stature. ANDREW HUBERMAN: given
male enters puberty 13 versus male enters puberty 15, can say
guy entered puberty 13 going shorter guy entered
puberty 15, not quite straightforward? KYLE GILLETT: identical
twins individual entered puberty age 13 also finished puberty, went
way Tanner stages-- bone scan, believe usually
done left wrist, says yes, growth plates mostly closed, not
going grow couple inches height that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Just related question. growing up, thought, least people
say, resistance training-- particular, lifting heavy weights stunt one's growth.
true false? KYLE GILLETT: false talking just lifting
heavy weights. Dirty bulking certainly potential stunt one's growth two main
mechanisms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: define dirty bulking? KYLE GILLETT:
[CHUCKLES] dirty bulking eating excess calories not just acquire lean
metabolically active body mass get stronger, purposely acquiring body fat.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: purposely acquiring muscle fat overeating lifting
weights can stunt one's growth. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
two things. young child, can-- fat can become
leptin resistant can produce leptin, leptin can activate
hypothalamus, activates pituitary, releases gonadotropin,
basically just increase testosterone estrogen earlier otherwise have.
mechanism behind childhood obesity causes early puberty. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: Interesting. remember paper published Science Magazine--
believe focused mainly females, showing enough body fat
accumulates, hormone leptin secreted, triggers onset puberty.
KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given increase childhood
obesity observing now, seeing earlier onset puberty males
females? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, males females. Not get technical,
G protein-coupled receptor hypothalamus leptin directly binds it,
appear directly cause causatory not just correlation. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understand correctly, saying young guy-- say, 13, 14--
wants really bulk deliberately-- deliberately, excuse me-- overeats,
squats, deadlifts, bench presses really trying get big, will
get big, lateral dimension. effectively limiting total height
can shut long bone growth limbs. correct? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. growth long bones mostly related estradiol alpha receptor,
basically, one receptors estrogen, can secondary early puberty
also related body fat conversion testosterone
estrogen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can assume young male wants get
resistance training bodyweight exercises probably OK maybe even
weight training, kettlebells, et cetera, avoid so-called
dirty bulking-- trying deliberately gain weight-- age? puberty
over? KYLE GILLETT: say individual limit amount abnormal
body fat accumulation, dirty bulking, indefinitely throughout entire life. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: again, understand correctly, recommendation avoid
deliberate weight gain rapid weight gain not just allow individual reach
maximum height, also avoid laying lot body fat cells. Correct? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. balance is, going puberty,
able add lot lean body mass-- not just muscle mass, bone mass
mass well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: started lifting weights 16,
confess trained pretty heavy times. don't know whether not
taller now, started training, already reached
least close predicted height. can't say deliberately waited grown.
just happened stumbled weight room found liked age
16, point, already height now. case,
hearing laying lot excess body fat not good idea. somebody


grows chubby fat whatever reason-- reasons related eating patterns
family, maybe even genetic reasons. safe and/or wise young
person-- say somebody around age puberty, even younger,
late teens-- dieting actively trying lose body fat. safe? KYLE
GILLETT: supervision physician, certainly safe change body
composition. pediatric obesity medicine, often talking recomposition

00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty

renormalization growth curve compared peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great. Thank you. may sensed, started chronologically puberty,
know another puberty even precedes puberty
familiar with. Maybe-- want just briefly mention talking
started. puberty familiar with, think
people familiar with, acquisition deepening voice, growth muscle
bone, body hair, acquisition libido things like that. actually second
puberty go through. Maybe just mention us educate us
first puberty. think people will hearing first time. KYLE
GILLETT: first puberty everyone's life first three months life.
may notice baby acne first three months also have,
general, just changes related androgens estrogens, perhaps oilier skin,
even genitourinary-- genital growth first three months. mostly
due DHEA, adrenal hormone. second puberty, puberty
people know of, actually starts way well. called adrenarche,
adrenals kick in, guess, second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
standard age age range testicles descend males? KYLE
GILLETT: Usually birth. not uncommon one even two
undescended testes, risk testicular cancer, especially not
fixed early also heat damage teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank
coverage two puberties. early life. imagine listeners
probably still one the-- well, one puberty. ones first
puberty, obviously, aren't aware listening podcast, maybe it'll
embedded subconscious. listeners probably still puberty.
think everyone can remember back puberty, roughly first entered


puberty,

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going

not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria

back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually

KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing

time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense

take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE

just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

HUBERMAN: Interesting. remember paper published Science Magazine--
believe focused mainly females, showing enough body fat
accumulates, hormone leptin secreted, triggers onset puberty.
KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given increase childhood
obesity observing now, seeing earlier onset puberty males
females? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, males females. Not get technical,
G protein-coupled receptor hypothalamus leptin directly binds it,
appear directly cause causatory not just correlation. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understand correctly, saying young guy-- say, 13, 14--
wants really bulk deliberately-- deliberately, excuse me-- overeats,
squats, deadlifts, bench presses really trying get big, will
get big, lateral dimension. effectively limiting total height
can shut long bone growth limbs. correct? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. growth long bones mostly related estradiol alpha receptor,
basically, one receptors estrogen, can secondary early puberty
also related body fat conversion testosterone
estrogen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can assume young male wants get
resistance training bodyweight exercises probably OK maybe even
weight training, kettlebells, et cetera, avoid so-called
dirty bulking-- trying deliberately gain weight-- age? puberty
over? KYLE GILLETT: say individual limit amount abnormal
body fat accumulation, dirty bulking, indefinitely throughout entire life. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: again, understand correctly, recommendation avoid
deliberate weight gain rapid weight gain not just allow individual reach
maximum height, also avoid laying lot body fat cells. Correct? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. balance is, going puberty,
able add lot lean body mass-- not just muscle mass, bone mass
mass well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: started lifting weights 16,
confess trained pretty heavy times. don't know whether not
taller now, started training, already reached
least close predicted height. can't say deliberately waited grown.
just happened stumbled weight room found liked age
16, point, already height now. case,
hearing laying lot excess body fat not good idea. somebody


grows chubby fat whatever reason-- reasons related eating patterns
family, maybe even genetic reasons. safe and/or wise young
person-- say somebody around age puberty, even younger,
late teens-- dieting actively trying lose body fat. safe? KYLE
GILLETT: supervision physician, certainly safe change body
composition. pediatric obesity medicine, often talking recomposition

00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty

renormalization growth curve compared peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great. Thank you. may sensed, started chronologically puberty,
know another puberty even precedes puberty
familiar with. Maybe-- want just briefly mention talking
started. puberty familiar with, think
people familiar with, acquisition deepening voice, growth muscle
bone, body hair, acquisition libido things like that. actually second
puberty go through. Maybe just mention us educate us
first puberty. think people will hearing first time. KYLE
GILLETT: first puberty everyone's life first three months life.
may notice baby acne first three months also have,
general, just changes related androgens estrogens, perhaps oilier skin,
even genitourinary-- genital growth first three months. mostly
due DHEA, adrenal hormone. second puberty, puberty
people know of, actually starts way well. called adrenarche,
adrenals kick in, guess, second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
standard age age range testicles descend males? KYLE
GILLETT: Usually birth. not uncommon one even two
undescended testes, risk testicular cancer, especially not
fixed early also heat damage teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank
coverage two puberties. early life. imagine listeners
probably still one the-- well, one puberty. ones first
puberty, obviously, aren't aware listening podcast, maybe it'll
embedded subconscious. listeners probably still puberty.
think everyone can remember back puberty, roughly first entered


puberty,

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion

not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel

HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce

cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic

well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride

miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

grows chubby fat whatever reason-- reasons related eating patterns
family, maybe even genetic reasons. safe and/or wise young
person-- say somebody around age puberty, even younger,
late teens-- dieting actively trying lose body fat. safe? KYLE
GILLETT: supervision physician, certainly safe change body
composition. pediatric obesity medicine, often talking recomposition

00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty

renormalization growth curve compared peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great. Thank you. may sensed, started chronologically puberty,
know another puberty even precedes puberty
familiar with. Maybe-- want just briefly mention talking
started. puberty familiar with, think
people familiar with, acquisition deepening voice, growth muscle
bone, body hair, acquisition libido things like that. actually second
puberty go through. Maybe just mention us educate us
first puberty. think people will hearing first time. KYLE
GILLETT: first puberty everyone's life first three months life.
may notice baby acne first three months also have,
general, just changes related androgens estrogens, perhaps oilier skin,
even genitourinary-- genital growth first three months. mostly
due DHEA, adrenal hormone. second puberty, puberty
people know of, actually starts way well. called adrenarche,
adrenals kick in, guess, second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
standard age age range testicles descend males? KYLE
GILLETT: Usually birth. not uncommon one even two
undescended testes, risk testicular cancer, especially not
fixed early also heat damage teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank
coverage two puberties. early life. imagine listeners
probably still one the-- well, one puberty. ones first
puberty, obviously, aren't aware listening podcast, maybe it'll
embedded subconscious. listeners probably still puberty.
think everyone can remember back puberty, roughly first entered


puberty,

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work

quickly aggregated secondary sex characteristics. like turn now
general question males order optimize
hormones. just list off things males daily basis,
weekly basis. mean, guys teens 20s getting bloodwork
done, taking supplements? already talked weight training.
avoid goal long
arc healthy hormone optimization throughout lifespan? KYLE GILLETT:
many things do. analogy often make brand
new car comes off assembly line, full scope diagnostic workup--
hook computer. think thing humans
well. puberty, obviously, functioning human, say still
development. think human always develops. don't think development
ever ends, want monitor progress across person's lifespan.
[INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. bloodwork-- mean,
earliest-- let put way. blood work didn't cost anything
everyone get it, want see everybody get bloodwork done
first time? Obviously, individuals age 18 talk parents
this. long parents child agree parents board
well, can start getting bloodwork. Often, child will come
complaints either precocious puberty delayed puberty, individual might
9 individual might 15. healthy child, going later
Tanner stages-- 4 5, developed several secondary sexual
characteristics-- might hair growth starting notice beard growth.
good time it. concerned stature heighth, not
tracking along members family have-- not just height
stature, also timing puberty, time get labs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: travel back time, gotten bloodwork done
hormones, lipids, everything else 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know
get that, didn't pressing clinical issues. think first
time got bloodwork done, late 20s, maybe even early 30s.


still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take
quick break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink covers foundational

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules

GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,

people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online

thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,

sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone

part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing

supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone

monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using

growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

still dying know bloodwork when, instance, 17 felt
certain way. confess many dimensions, actually feel better now at--
47 soon-- 47 teens 20s. think
psychological side. think that-- terms just understanding felt great
felt feel terrible not great, think bloodwork extremely informative.
think key things look bloodwork? mean, testosterone
always topic comes context male hormone optimisation, certainly
lot hormones important well. KYLE GILLETT:
testosterone, want get either testosterone SHBG free testosterone.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: define SHBG listeners, please? KYLE
GILLETT: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. protein binds
androgens estrogen body. stronger androgen, stronger binds.
puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT strongest bioidentical
androgen, huge role-- prominent role secondary sexual characteristics.
SHBG high, DHT can run higher not metabolized,
not quite much free DHT. want balance high enough free
DHT high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: obviously, blood
tests going read interpreted qualified physician. people
aren't going position evaluate properly, least not full
depth M.D like looking them. everyone
get bloodwork early possible depending budget availability.
everybody terms monitoring markers? assuming
no major intervention, often recommend people get
bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: say-- take individual just turned 18,
just got first set bloodwork. probably find something
may want optimize using shared decision-making physician. Usually, good
follow-up six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: twice year, getting
bloodwork done, physician evaluate it. sounds reasonable me.
didn't initiate 18, myself, guess best time start


00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones

soon possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terms


things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic

well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action

cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

things males do, meaning males ages-- puberty
beyond-- things? daily basis, maybe just take
us arc day push protocols use
things like see male patients use order try optimize
hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: briefly touch lifestyle pillars start.
Diet exercise first to. puberty, sleep particularly important, course.
diet exercise, throughout lifespan, want not exclude things
helping you. example, puberty consuming dairy,
sudden cut dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 free IGF-1. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just, again, audience, maybe just mention enough
IGF-1 can us beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: helps grow. helps
genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, long bone growth-- skin
growth, hair growth, host things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting array
nutrients include dairy. sorts nutrients important
development? KYLE GILLETT: want adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps
testosterone production, helps, again, bone mineralization stature.
age 25-- not strict cutoff, age 25,
optimizing growth hormone IGF-1 helps bone density bone growth.
dietary standpoint, want enough free estrogen-- not much
growing. want help basically stockpile bone prevent risk
osteoporosis thin bone fractures older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
someone broke left foot 5 times high school, can say whatever
young people can optimize bone density great. problem seems
resolved time, don't know. Back then, short run
vegetarian, always omnivore. realize relates ethics,
food allergies, things sort. say that, balance,
people benefit eating combination quality proteins animal sources
non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, starches? mean, think,
instance, people following pure carnivore pure vegan diet
20s 30s? KYLE GILLETT: late 20s, might reasonable option. early
20s certainly teens, horrible idea likely significantly decrease
free androgens. will less testosterone acting receptors
body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: micronutrients macronutrients
people 20s 30s emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: haven't really


touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors

HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.

HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many

sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized

mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.

GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard

different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking

KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make

KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies

different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked

often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

touched fatty acids fiber much. Fiber going paramount kind setting
set point gut microbiome rest life. prebiotic fiber,
can think fish food good gut microbiome. gut microbiome kind
like aquarium fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, just thinking
goldfish swimming around that-- goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-
- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live dead. KYLE GILLETT:
Yeah, fiber food putting gut, either going skew
gut microbiome toward something beneficial detrimental. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: say prebiotic fiber getting essential fatty acids,
important throughout lifespan just people 20s
30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout lifespan, particularly important teenage,
'20s, '30s, helps brain development. certainly expert
comes brain development, continue develop, really,
throughout lifespan, certainly 20s 30s well. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: taking multivitamin growing up? many
people that. necessary, useful? not necessary, safe
anyway? KYLE GILLETT: generally safe anyway. not think everybody
needs multivitamin. exclusionary diet is-- example,
celiac disease planning fertility soon, perhaps reasonable
take multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: previous discussion ours, asked
caloric restriction testosterone. recall correctly, idea
somebody overweight-- excess fat, adipose tissue-- getting rid
adipose tissue caloric restriction exercise, provided done
not fast healthy way, going beneficial testosterone long-run.
individuals not carrying excess body fat, caloric restriction
actually going lower testosterone. First all, correct? second,
addendums like give us now? KYLE GILLETT: correct.
look individual caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One
less building blocks hormones. Another will catabolic
state often, balance anabolism catabolism will different.
likely less signaling growth hormone IGF-1, also high
SHBG defined earlier binding protein, free androgens free
estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. touched sleep
critical. say throughout lifespan, trying get enough quality sleep least


80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate

fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people

80% nights life, 20% just happens
noise outside stressed. just-- exam great time
whatever reason. lot good reasons lose sleep

00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose

now well. sleep, got nutrition. touched that.
get back supplementation. Now, pillars creating
proper environment hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress probably
next one. puberty, also 20s 30s, individuals figuring
want cope stress also figuring want choose put
effort into. someone overstressed, can have-- can put
lifestyle pillars-- stop dieting well, stop exercising, everything else
can go askew. also degree social component this, perhaps need
add seventh pillar social. 20s 30s, may forming family
well. Perhaps children, health family unit going vitally
important not only-- not necessarily directly hormone optimisation, going
throw everything else off off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people not
starting families 20s 30s, can social connection extended
friendships work relationships well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. fact,
someone's not starting family, just concerning, reasons.
individual going close group family friends. someone
not one connections, things can potentially get bad not just
individually, also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say stress,
mean learn manage stress. look like? mean, patient
high blood pressure, even don't, just sense stressed.
lot pressured speech, not feeling well, communicating
not well. things recommend order try
ameliorate stress? KYLE GILLETT: different mindfulness relaxation
techniques. Going outside can often help well. Dietary changes exercise
can help too. people like prayer meditation. lot people like
counseling therapy, even just talking openly family member friend.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: pillars hormone
optimization? Here, feel like not just talking people 20s 30s,


again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take
quick break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink covers foundational
nutritional needs. taking Athletic Green since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens
reason still take athletic Greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health. gut important. populated gut


microbiota communicate brain, immune system, basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health.
probiotics Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health.
addition, Athletic Greens contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great.

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone

Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically

cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart

KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,

HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw

actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone

KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

again, wrapping arms around basically puberty onward. mean, gosh, looking
back, started meditating pretty early, started weight training running early. gave
thought diet high school, really college started thinking
ingesting trying better there. people
coming table different stages life trying optimize hormones.
additional things everybody do? KYLE GILLETT:
Everyone get outside find movement pastime last lifetime.
going get sunlight, going get degree heat cold exposure,
also just going move more. artificial environment,
artificial lights artificial air conditioning, going many effects body.
vital. Another one finding purpose life. call spirit,
really just self-actualization component Maslow's hierarchy needs,
basically physical needs, mental needs, purpose life--
really like do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking goal target.
always say don't stick goal time. Certainly, haven't
although got started early science game still it. idea not pick
end goal, pick goal. reach goal assess,
pick another goal, on. think sometimes, people hear picking
purpose, like, oh, goodness, define--

00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication

sort like naming oneself-- actually can change goals purpose
time. terrific. suggest people actively use avoid
supplementation prior things? somebody likes throw
kitchen sink things, also like things pretty systematically. say
behavior first, nutrition, supplementation, maybe if, if,
real need-- course, working doctor-- prescription drugs.
probably people 20s 30s-- maybe even 50s-- aren't feeling
great, want something order able train feel
confident seek social connection. just try go whole business
side well. thoughts that? KYLE GILLETT: see
supplements medications similar-- one prescribed one not.
general, medications side effects potentially stronger therapeutic


efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

efficacy. just tools reach end goal. depending goal,
individual athlete, certainly consider
supplementation. someone desires optimal high level cognitive
performance, also consider supplementation. time, food
medicine, lot benefits can get supplements, can get food
well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess depends much time energy
willing spend also finances. know college, afford just
supplements, basically whey protein fish oil--
fortunate pointed direction things-- creatine.
couldn't afford much else. time, course, afford more. really
often depend finances. get specific recommendations

00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire

optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, want ask
question wondering long time. often discussion
male hormone optimization, people will say, well, libido suffering, might
want concerned testosterone-- even estrogen know
estrogen can impact libido well. Sometimes, estrogen low detrimental
libido. people will say, not recovering workouts just
feeling kind depressed. problem is, subjective. [CHUCKLES]
one know whether not recovery workouts, energy,
confidence, libido within healthy range? mean, obviously, people
relationship can know whether not libido matches sort cadence
relationship partner. people think maybe
start talk it? one big differences, think, males
females that, females monthly cycle, familiar
changes occur hormones time every 28 days, hormones
changing dramatically ways impact physiology psychology.
males, feel like dearth language get subtle aspects this.
also privacy issues people feeling like don't want overshare
much-- not knowing appropriate share. talk patient
30s, maybe even 70s 60s-- doesn't matter-- male patient,
listening for? know not psychiatrist, ears tuned


order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see

indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic

well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,

order try figure whether not person really use help
hormone optimization whether not something else-- maybe just
great don't realize placing demands
excessive? KYLE GILLETT: want use lot open-ended questions.
process called motivational interviewing. goal listen patient
not plant idea mind can follow everybody going
different goal. people better reading biofeedback telling
feel daily basis. screening questionnaires designed-- example,
ADAM questionnaire look men's men's health hormone-related health.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: available online people administer themselves.
Although don't want people making clinical diagnoses anyone else,
sort exam? KYLE GILLETT: is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE
GILLETT: don't believe clinically-validated tool like ASCVD, like risk
heart attack stroke tool many tools. one depression,
one anxiety. called PHQ9 GAD7 respectively. anyway, often
in-- ADAM questionnaire-- hear patient,
careful listener, often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can give example
questions ADAM questionnaire sorts motivational
interviewing might do? say patient. sit down. sorts
questions ask probe kinds dimensions hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Questions libido, questions athletic performance, questions
motivation. often, patient will answer one thing, hear
subjectively far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can give
example question? happy guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: classic
one is, guy comes in-- lot times, say, oh, no, wife made go
doctor. go year, it. don't want anything, don't want medications.
screening questionnaires might zeros across board, nothing. No issues.
apparently perfect health. talk while, get rapport,
like you, right finishing visit go room,
mention libido isn't quite there, little bit ED well,
perhaps even chest pressure tightness. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: see. right leaving room, patient will tell


sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take
quick break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink covers foundational
nutritional needs. taking Athletic Green since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens
reason still take athletic Greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health. gut important. populated gut


microbiota communicate brain, immune system, basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health.
probiotics Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health.
addition, Athletic Greens contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great.
like try Athletic Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman,

vitamin D3, K2. Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically

day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like

cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make

safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether

sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone

want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

sexual side effects-- not side effects. sexual
challenges, mention chest pressure. chest pressure general
decoy for, got heart, related things reporting?
KYLE GILLETT: can related. fact, erectile dysfunction known canary
coal mine. coal miners take canary down, would-- canary
die coal miners of, believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
often, one causes ED plaque buildup, can happen coronaries
well. sometimes, notice symptom genitals
coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: patient, say patient
young person plaque buildup arteries veins not likely
they're, say, 20s 30s, next step interview
point, consider? immediately order labs person
try rule kind actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT:
certainly order labs. individuals similar,
come in, symptoms, one individual might very,
high testosterone, one individual might severely hypogonadal. big
difference subjective labs look like. certainly order labs.
also ask situational not, ask ED they're--
ask habits. even ask porn, masturbation,
issues. course, doctor patient. depending
tell you, can often determine situational component--
people call psychogenic ED, don't love term psychogenic ED, kind
puts blame patient's mind. lot time, case.
even test. rarely ordered, called nocturnal penile tumescence.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, true periodic erections sleep--
correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. basically put cuff see
normal sized erection sleep. believe 90% time test,
indeed erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point

00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & Dopamine “Wave Pool”

psychogenic origin whatever challenges terms sexual
interactions. mentioned porn masturbation. topic come bunch
times podcast podcasts gone relationship


dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid

balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive

people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online

thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,

sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone

part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing

supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using

tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

dopamine sexual motivation sexual behavior. pretty
strong stance that, not judging porn masturbation, can create brain wiring
situation males particular essentially teach brain aroused
watching people sex opposed first person actor sexual
interactions. sense, brain wiring, neuroplasticity,
dopamine. thoughts porn masturbation relate
hormones? mean, big debate internet. fact, one common
debates whether not masturbation increases decreases testosterone males.
Certainly, will decrease motivation go find sexual partners. know this. KYLE
GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: data
time. terms effects pornography masturbation-- here, suppose
need somewhat specific operationally define talking about.
talking porn masturbation point ejaculation,
understanding ejaculation orgasm associated causes increase
prolactin, blunts libido period time. duration will vary
person person circumstance circumstance. basically, points
fact porn masturbation can really limit libido real world. me,
pornography screen not real world. Although screens exist real
world, real world doesn't exist screen. KYLE GILLETT: accurate
statement, prolactin significant acute increase ejaculation.
degree orgasm well, prolactin acts pituitary inhibit
release hormones LH FSH, LH can increase testosterone.
may one cases dose makes poison. frequent
habit, certainly daily day detrimental hormonal
component not even taking account neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Listen, think terrific actually defined frequency,
problem internet even doctor's office. see descriptions
pornography dangerous certain things detrimental hormones. People say
frequent, frequent? saying daily multiple times per day
potentially detrimental hormone profile male essentially age. KYLE
GILLETT: just masturbation. pornography-- porn use well,
likely worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: that? Just sort
dopaminergic drive stimulus-- just really intense visual stimulus? KYLE
GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. think using analogy dopamine wave pool,


deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take
quick break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink covers foundational

microbiota communicate brain, immune system, basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health.
probiotics Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health.

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone

scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like

cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart

testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,

HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone

various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

deepen pool, not increase supply dopamine. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Maybe describe dopamine wave pool think
powerful way thinking dopamine dopamine does. fact,
always credited done it, generally stolen analogy
dopamine wave pool astute. KYLE GILLETT: dopamine wave pool
describes natural variation ups downs dopamine motivation.
wave pool, depending high peak is, often deeper
trough. not want high peak. addition, peak very, high--
example, using many substances like cocaine like amphetamines,
dopamine can go high lose almost water wave pool,
crash that, not trough low, less dopamine
pool begin with. dopamine receptor extremely sensitive, Gaba
receptor, inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine technically stimulant
related adrenaline noradrenaline. depth pool can change
quick. want happy medium fairly near top,
not near top depth pool going go down. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: interpret context discussion libido, sex, porn,
masturbation, somebody intense sexual experience-- here,
not necessarily talking intense orgasm-- talking just lot intense
visual, very-- lot intense imagery, auditory input, both-- going lead
situation dopamine going depleted afterwards. guest
podcast before-- colleague Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert
addiction, talked bit this-- sort seesawing. Like, here, talking
wave crashing water wave pool. There, seesawing
pleasure pain. going longer deeper period lack
pleasure following that. think lot people think, oh, well, great. want
intense experience. intense experience coming pornography
masturbation-- suppose coming high adrenaline activities, like life-risking
parkour hanging off side building-- inevitably going lead depressive
episodes, low libido episodes follow. right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct--
similar physiologic way withdrawal stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Now, sex partner different? many people
chasing intense experiences partner opposed
pornography masturbation. Again, here, talking ages.


always say, anytime talking sex partner, talking-- four
conditions always lay Huberman Lab podcast talking
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate
interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, also case dose makes
poison. there's-- obviously, meeting criteria, one preference
that, them, positive experience, likely OK. not going
able maintain dopamine certain threshold long period time,
well may crash experience well. crash may different
one partner other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. draw analogy
food. like don't serve banquet meal seven nights
week, maybe just two. right? delicious foods there? Can--
KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use analogy? KYLE GILLETT:
--that reasonable. not trying PG-13. just trying parsimony Occam's
razor ability describe lot things words. like return key
things people do-- say, key things men
optimize hormones. talked getting movement, getting
sunlight, getting quality social connection one way other, avoid excessively
frequent masturbation viewing pornography. people, zero might
optimal number. keep coming back this-- KYLE GILLETT: people.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for people. Interesting. feel fortunate grown
prior availability internet pornography. never big consumer
pornography. just not thing, hear often males ages
addiction it, affliction it. really serious issue, one
reasons grateful

00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

willing talk clinical experience patients. like take
quick break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink covers foundational

microbiota communicate brain, immune system, basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health.
probiotics Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health.

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel

say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen Hormone Health

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. terms
exercise, here's-- again, double-edged sword. one hand, great get
exercise, familiar with-- train hour day-- 10 minutes warm-up 50
minutes hour weight training 50 minutes hour cardio, feel great,
especially if, week, take complete day off. sort general schedule.
also familiar go runs excessively long-- two hour runs
spend 90 minutes gym frequently, start feel like garbage. Everything suffers.
sleep starts suffer. doesn't matter much eat-- don't seem recover.
don't feel well. realize recovery ability varies individuals,
think healthy, sustainable exercise regimen anyone can follow will also
support hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: really vigorous exercise, around
three four times week sustainable long period time. top that,
add 3 four instances less vigorous exercise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: less vigorous, mean zone two cardio can hold
conversation, beyond can't? vigorous thinking
weight training high intensity interval type training? right? KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. can also weight train benefit even low moderate
intensity. think weight training have-- not necessarily
related incidence DOMS, Delayed Onset Muscle soreness.
weight train lazy easy time time-- obviously, want weight train
heavy time time well lean body mass growth.
weight train lighter, going able often, can still help


hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel

say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people

hypertrophy collagen-- example, tendons ligaments. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: here, again, like perhaps drill notion intensity light
weights me, brutal workouts ever done
consider high repetition range-- 15 50. Actually, went Oregon watch
International Track Field Championships. went Cameron Haynes's
place-- Cameron Haynes-- trainer put us workout
25 50 repetitions per set, done circuit, brutal. light--
mean, weights nothing. cases, body weight. number
repetitions brutal. say limiting intensity, talking
limiting number sets failure, talking really kind lazy
bear gym? like every once-- long rest, sort thing.
thoughts relates hormone optimization? just mention--
let answer-- feel best overall training 10 minute warm-ups
45 50 minutes weight training, pretty lazy sets. Two
three minute rests, training somewhere 6 10 rep range, going failure every
while, mostly getting sort last rep think failure.
No forced reps, kind thing. jogging days, nice easy.
that, feel fantastic dimensions life. train intensely
that, even lightweight, faster cadence lower rest, feel like garbage.
get headache, kind ornery, everything suffers. thoughts
defining optimal exercise strategy hormones. never measured hormones
two different contexts, imagine cortisol related. KYLE
GILLETT: study effect exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one
area studied vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer hour.
usually track rating perceived exertion, isn't perfect, not
extremely actionable, helpful clinical science. takeaway is,
basically, not-- not hormonally helpful train, especially regularly train,
vigorously longer hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: happy hear
sounds like people, hour work really threshold. think
important people hear, especially males think
incredible examples people like Cam, like David Goggins, people
training long periods time-- leaving aside issues people
order optimize recovery, think hour day exercise just great
program anyone can follow. beyond hour, start running


challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone

OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.

scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like

cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart

testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.

HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid

really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people

challenges. occasional 90-minute two hour workout no big deal.
start every two months, think headed trouble.
seen people's blood work hormones? ever see
people just badly overtrained just training hard
often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. blood work particularly bad, often
large caloric deficit well. synergistic effect caloric deficit. Even
maintaining adequate protein intake, might not maintaining adequate iron
intake adequate vitamin D. also just literally caloric deficit. Perhaps
low carbs well, low free testosterone. simultaneously lot
vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. often hear, starting
wonder whether not, quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like
dropping carbohydrates, quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting
six day week really intense workouts-- whether not, short run, work
cause cosmetic changes people seeking, really
undermine overall goal, is, least me, hormones Maybe. not
optimized 100%, always aiming 100% close every stage
life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency key here. not consistent, law
diminishing returns certainly applies. 80% 90% benefit many, many
months far better 100%, half time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
One thing found tremendously useful finish workout still
energy, not take exhaustion. able talk dopamine
wave pool. able sort ride rest day feeling great. sort save
bank vigor training bring work. again,
not athlete. get paid think speak, not lift weights run. KYLE
GILLETT: Another component balance sympathetic,
fight flight nervous system, parasympathetic, rest
digest nervous system. anecdote, likely true, many elite
bodybuilders parasympathetic besides lifting weights. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: mean lazy like eat lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: lazy bear gym kind phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT:
Absolutely. said, very, vigorous workout-- example, one
trained failure, bodybuilders power lifters time--
feel tiredness-- feel strain heavy sympathetic activity
lifting heavy weight, can potentially affect feel rest day.


many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.

compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going

not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve

say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized

mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause

backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron

KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing

somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total

pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make

safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense

take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE

acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

many people job highly cognitive not like
extremely vigorous workout morning, lot people able
exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: exercise early morning-- is,
9:00 AM-- energy day long. mid-morning, experienced
afternoon crash. probably circadian biology there. also
noticed-- actually seen bloodwork-- don't get 45-minute
jog least week, blood profiles suffer direction don't want
go.

00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

particular, testosterone estrogen move directions not conducive
goals. like talk approaches people can use order
optimize hormones. days, better worse-- think worse-- younger
guys asking using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT.
just want frame saying no strict cutoff TRT.
plenty people whose blood levels testosterone estrogen within normal
reference range decide start things. course, can limit fertility.
bunch issues even non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance
enhancing dosages. love frame first defining terms, one
challenges internet people talk TRT, talk
performance enhancing drugs, talk steroids. steroids. mean,
testosterone, estrogen steroid hormones. one considers replacement
therapy versus one considers performance enhancing going depend.
question. world-- [EMPHASIS] world-- male
teens twenties, even 30s, whose blood levels testosterone estrogen
appropriate levels, meaning within normal reference range, take
exogenous testosterone given negative effects fertility, challenges
can present dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. that,
certainly not paid particular endeavor, like not making
money? playing sport, chances not allowed anyway.
banned substances list. me, just seems like crazy idea.
again, generation really hasn't thought stuff people
40s 50s even never. ever case somebody


20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

decreased blood return heart increased blood veins
themselves. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break thank sponsor

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat

HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart

interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus

cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

20s 30s take testosterone blood levels within 300 900 nanograms
per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. reason
performance enhancing drug, whether not steroid, synthetic, bioidentical,
otherwise, varies lot. individuals cosmetic reasons even can
deleterious effects cosmetic appearance, example, skin
long run. everyone different reasons. far like benefit
outweigh detriment, not often 20s certainly-- probably--
almost hardly never.

01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)

always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome whatnot, almost never
young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people 20s, 30s, beyond--
40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone estrogen levels appropriate ratios,
within normal reference range, feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES]
talked ADAMs exam-- sort like feel-pretty-good code libido,
energy, recovery, et cetera, feeling least workable lifestyle.
people, can besides get great sleep, train, not hard often, et
cetera, et cetera? things realm supplementation can
help optimize testosterone estrogen without suppressing
endogenous production testosterone estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: mention
creatine first one. Creatine interesting multiple different effects.
helps amino acid synthesis. also helps oxidative stress. can also serve
backup fuel tank mitochondria, holding backup ATP. slightly
increase total testosterone, also increases conversion testosterone
dihydrotestosterone, potentially especially useful men even teenage
years 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned conversion
testosterone dihydrotestosterone, mythology creatine can
increase hair loss, guessing least one study showing creatine
can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. DHT one primary hormones
can promote male pattern baldness. question therefore is, creatine
supplementation increase rate hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, can,
individual, preventing hair loss poor reason take creatine,
not going take supraphysiologic level, not going increase


androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

decreased blood return heart increased blood veins
themselves. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break thank sponsor

01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need

pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas

androgens unnormal level binding. feel like this-- reason not
take creatine hair loss, that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean-- sorry-- hair
loss not reason avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss not
reason avoid taking creatine. Think just bringing naturally
inclined have. conversion testosterone DHT already high, often,
creatine not affect this. just kind resets balance testosterone
aromatized estrogen 5-alpha reduced DHT. not going speed
hair loss just naturally male does. individuals, will
no effect. individuals-- whatever reason, almost no 5-alpha
reductase activity-- will return natural normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see.
Well, take 5 grams day creatine monohydrate. tissue volumizing
effects, exercise benefits, also cognitive effects. don't know
increasing hair loss. mean, got little bit widow's peak type hair loss.
me. suppose beard growth associated DHT too. right?
KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: learned-- haven't
literature long time-- differences receptors,
DHT causes hair growth face hair loss head. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Yes, amount, sensitivity, density receptors
genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true mother's father
bald will bald pattern, wasn't, won't? KYLE
GILLETT: decent correlation. Part proposed mechanism this-- well,
several genes, can actually test genes hair loss. get
decent amount mother. unique thing get mother
may gotten father-- got one copies
father-- X chromosome. androgen receptor gene X
chromosome, men got androgen receptor gene mother. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: X chromosome, not Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT:
Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though the, quote, unquote,
male promoting genes Y chromosome, like malaria, inhibiting, et cetera.
Interesting. 5 grams day creatine people fine. Beneficial
tissue volumizing-- strength, bringing water muscles-- cognitive
effects. clinical support creatine, think, quite strong 5 gram per day
dosage. sorts supplements can people benefit from? already talked
omegas making sure people getting enough prebiotic fiber


support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

decreased blood return heart increased blood veins

01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

support gut microbiome vitamin D. supplement-based tools can
people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one can loop creatine betaine.
people nonresponders creatine, can increase 10 grams,
can use cousin betaine help amino acid synthesis shunting energy.
Along that, put l-carnitine actually smallest peptide hormone.
just two amino acids put together, a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
hormone? Interesting. not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: just-- not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: call peptide
hormone. not call l-carnitine hormone, call
dopamine hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, could-- neurohormone.
hard define things transmitters hormones level. agree. l-carnitine--
actually, backtrack. Betaine-- recall dosage people typically
take creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 3 grams. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: fact-- yeah-- several versions creatine
betaine mixed helps processing methionine
homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: somebody already taking creatine
likes responds it-- raise hand-- myself, adding betaine help
redundant creatine? KYLE GILLETT: homocysteine
persistently elevated. homocysteine kind like inflammatory marker can
build not converting enough stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know? KYLE GILLETT: Just blood test knew MTHFR
polymorphism, basically add methyl groups many things body.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. side effects betaine people aware
of? KYLE GILLETT: Not know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look
on-- examine.com great site that. surely list it. just revamped
site way, awesome before, platinum now. l-carnitine--
ways take l-carnitine? know oral forms capsules
injectables. injectables, think need prescription. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. need prescription injectables, really get
prescription injectables. inject it-- course, supervision
doctor-- usually done intramuscularly. aqueous solution, not
oil carrier oil like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, inject
superficially, not going make break anything. Often, just burns
inject subcutaneously not disseminate throughout body well. L-


carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:

KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid

thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive

peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense

take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

carnitine potentially localized effects inject it. ingest orally,
low bioavailability-- maybe 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think
people going able get l-carnitine only-- capsule form.
dosages l-carnitine one needs ingest want get benefit
10% absorbed, probably lot l-carnitine. much
people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, recommend oral l-carnitine
1,000 milligrams 4,000 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
1 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. 5 grams day.
much, especially dysregulated gut microbiome,
concerned TMAO potential carcinogen carnitine choline
can convert into. gut microbiota determine much happens. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: true can offset negative effects alpha GPC-- choline
is-- l-carnitine take ingesting garlic? right? KYLE GILLETT:
compound garlic called allicin-- believe A-L-L-I-C-I-N. also part scientific
name-- genus types garlic. can help decrease conversion
TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases conversion TMAO well probably
alteration gut microbiome. just optimizing gut microbiome
can decrease conversion. not everyone needs allicin, something
certainly consider high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going
continue take 600 milligrams garlic every time take l-carnitine,
going skip berberine berberine gives brutal headaches makes
crave carbohydrates drops blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: many
effects, including dawn phenomenon drops blood sugar
sleeping can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not fan
berberine, sorry are. not trying offend anyone,
although frankly, offended stance berberine, maybe
another discussion. case injectable l-carnitine, one can get
doctor, much absorbed much one take? KYLE
GILLETT: Almost absorbed. general taking 500 milligrams
to-- can take pretty high dose 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not talk l-carnitine does? someone
go this? optimize testosterone, working receptor side?
l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: shuttle. think named carnitine
palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, just takes nutrients outside mitochondria


puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone
molecule limiting amount so-called free testosterone available
impact cells. Dr. Peter Attia podcast-- fact, sitting
chair-- said ideal level free testosterone males 2%
one's total testosterone. agree number disagree? sure Peter


fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

puts in. also unique effect-- well, not unique tadalafil
actually effect well-- increases density androgen receptor
cytoplasm cells. even androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't
change even testosterone not change, will testosterone
binding increased number receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one need
cycle

01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone

l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason cycle those.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: supplements can one use try improve
hormone profiles? here, realize using broad brush
say improve hormone profiles, really talking about? me, least,
think subjective stuff. people feel like going energy
consequence things, going optimized
libido, going optimized recovery exercise? Because,
mean, not clear taking one's testosterone 600 800 always going
good thing, especially estrogen increasing parallel. cause
issues. certainly make things better. certainly make things worse.
backdrop, things people can take? go
back issue really optimization. KYLE GILLETT: briefly mention
vitamin D, also hormone. actually sterile hormone.
deficient vitamin D replace it, will optimize testosterone. also
mention boron. high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower usually
dose 5 12 milligrams per day. not really sustained effect, boron
depleted soils many countries. believe high soils Greece Turkey.
eating dates raisins areas potentially boron. Boron
also might one reasons reference range testosterone much
higher countries countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
remind people, SHBG sex hormone binding globulin attaching testosterone

fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people

varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.

Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically

day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart

KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,

actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked

often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

fine said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% good rule
thumb. Usually, reference range 1% 4%. people
genetic polymorphisms SHBG, specific gene mutation
low SHBGs. Also men varicose veins testes, also known
varicoceles, tend high SHBGs, percentage likely less
2%. just percentage free T total T little bit 2%,
OK. just need figure reason is. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
somebody know varicose veins testicles, especially
testicles still in-- attached body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, hard tell.
several grades. grade 3 grade 4 varicocele,
called bag worms appearance. think just resistance trained,
really hot day, wearing tight fitting clothing, feel almost
feels like worms scrotum. way do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just that-- yeah, anyway. think parasites hear that, not
referring to. talking just texture. KYLE GILLETT: best
way people check valsalva long period time. valsalva,
venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can explain valsalva
people? KYLE GILLETT: bearing like lifting weight bowel
movement, swallow. lot times, can almost see build blood
jugular veins well.

01:15:34 InsideTracker

01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways

get 20% off InsideTracker's plans. insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off. vitamin D3-- guessing talking vitamin D3 specifically
say vitamin D-- boron, 5 12 milligrams per day.
things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

things optimize testosterone supplement form? KYLE
GILLETT: can talk things affect steroidogenesis cascade.
touch tongkat ali. know talked little bit before-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: guessing number people probably haven't heard
conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known Long Jack. upregulates several
different enzymes steroidogenesis cascade. that, mean if--
another good thing Google-- think anybody interested hormone optimization
understand sterile hormones come from. come usually
cholesterol can shunted off vitamin D easily, can shunted off
testosterone, estrogens, progestins quite easily well. tongkat helps
conversion multiple key steps synthesize testosterone. Another-- think
like coenzyme cofactor-- upregulator steps insulin IGF-
1. good rule thumb not expecting much growth hormone, insulin,
IGF-1-- example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, trying cut body fat
body weight-- tongkat going theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sorts dosages tongkat recommend patients?
KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere 300 1,200 milligrams day. tongkat, need
careful standardization because-- thinking general
tongkat supplement, far well-studied-- looking
eurycomanone content, plant compound likely main active
pharmacologic effect. compound effect body.
standardize eurycomanone very, high, theoretically
effect lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: take 400 milligrams tongkat ali per


day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various

KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make

not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release

actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,

dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing

take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor

prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid

testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene

reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature

actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone

like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big

HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low

taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

day. take early day bit stimulant effect, take
2:00 PM, starts inhibit sleep. taking years. rather like
effects. seems subtle consistent. never cycled it. recommend
cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: don't see reason cycle it. reason cycle
supplements, no reason cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood
work tells causes increase free testosterone also slight
increase luteinizing hormone me. effects various
hormones observed bloodwork patients taking tongkat ali?
KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. high
SHBG-- again, protein binds androgens estrogens--
extremely important protein-- higher SHBG, helps decrease it.
studied tongkat populations normal SHBGs nothing
SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. mean nothing
somebody overall? somebody SHBG normal range, will taking
tongkat benefit way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase total
free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. it-- known effects
anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, purely steroid
synthesis pathways? steroid-- say synthesis, receptor, modulation
pathways. KYLE GILLETT: no direct effect pathways. However,
time alter free androgen free estrogen, particularly one without altering
other, will alter binding protein binds thyroid hormones. change
make, whether natural optimization hormone replacement, going slightly
skew thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example see
often clinically someone starts, say, estrogen replacement testosterone
replacement-- maybe taking AI testosterone replacement--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, aromatase
inhibitor, blocks conversion estrogen. taking testosterone
little estrogen, going decrease binding protein, also known
thyroxine binding globulin, binds active thyroid hormones. start TRT
either low aromatase activity no aromatase activity-- no conversion
estrogen-- free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually
feedback inhibition, body talks says, need make
less this. acutely, not always enough time. going
high thyroid hormones can tachycardia, fast heart


rate can feel kind like overly fight flight due increased thyroid hormone
activity tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. tongkat ali-- just broad
range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

range--

01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone

300 1,200 milligrams per day. realize source matters there.
hormones prescribe patients not want go
testosterone replacement therapy take exogenous DHEA anything like that?
KYLE GILLETT: can talk fadogia next. Fadogia interesting because--
genus plants. Fadogia agrestis one them. many others
interesting. species likely well-studied, will increase LH,
not consider LH mimetic, doesn't really mimetic. increases
release luteinizing hormone pituitary. hormone binds
Leydig cell LH receptor kind like hCG does. will increase release
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: see. think people aren't familiar
hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- basically synthetic luteinizing hormone
luteinizing hormone hormone released pituitary going travel
testes stimulate production sperm testosterone, mainly
testosterone. correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH
also known little r LH, recombinant LH. hCG can synthetic, often,
just refined urine pregnant ladies since placenta makes it.
called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: getting
pregnant women's urine? mean, location? mean, not want go there,
just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- women
that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. high. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Donating urine, purifying it, men
injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT:
actually menopausal ladies. first trimester pregnant ladies,
can make non-synthetic hCG. menotropins also known--
couple different names it, like menopur. menopausal ladies
high LH FSH, refine FSH LH. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: moving away sources urine, Fadogia agrestis,
dosages patients take? heard potential toxicity testicular


cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

cells. KYLE GILLETT: one study-- rat study, can equate
dose toxicity rats humans. not give rats antioxidants,
increases couple different proinflammatory markers. One GGT, gamma
glutamate transferase. comes testes liver, one alkaline
phosphatase, also known Alkphos, again, coming areas. several
different ways can attenuate increase. can also just check see
increased. rat dose equates humans no effect--
safe dose-- average 300 milligrams day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
300 milligrams day humans dosage not toxicity.
Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. often, even toxicity rats, not
toxicity humans. not directly equitable, safe, another regimen
people take 600 milligrams every day 600 milligrams three times
week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
interesting relevant, taking fadogia period time.
markers tests indicate no toxicity. taking 600 milligrams
per day, cycling 8 12 weeks weeks off.
based saying, thinking maybe three times per week every
day might better. right? KYLE GILLETT: weren't going get labs,
certainly regimen want. going check GGT ALK
phos, even take things prevent increasing, can certainly
aggressive fadogia dosing. can increase quite bit,
dose dependent response activities associated high testosterone
also just LH testosterone. aggressive regimen 600 milligrams
daily month take one two weeks off.

01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. think less doing. Terrific.
terms hormones, supplements can support growth
hormone-- hormone associated tissue repair and, cases,
metabolism fat loss? tools, nutritional and/or supplement-
based, one can tap growth hormone pathway? lump IGF-1
since essentially working along dimensions. KYLE GILLETT:
quick synopsis-- growth hormone peptide hormone, released


pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW

appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least

cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic

well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related

least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,

pituitary. growth hormone releasing hormone ghrelin stimulate
release. also peptides analogous two things.
pulsatile secretion growth hormone fast half life just minutes,
increases IGF-1. peripheral IGF-1 central IGF-1 IGF2, no
need get specifics. happy medium growth hormone
adequate level IGF-1 adequate level. Usually, two
congruent. cases, just check IGF-1 and, occasionally, binding
peptides IGF-1 kind like SHBG talked earlier, estimating
free IGF-1. kind confusing hormone-- almost hormones
binding proteins help regulate them. often, want look free testosterone,
free estradiol, free IGF-1-- least estimate it-- free cortisol even, free thyroid
hormone. talking growth hormone IGF-1, usually don't
need anything optimize it. diabetic, then-- depending type
diabetes, IGF-1 growth hormone can high. Specifically, type 1
diabetes, growth hormone extremely high, IGF-1 low.
dysregulated state pathology, just talk doctor IGF-1
growth hormone. Taking amino acids go bed potentially help
growth hormone release just growth hormone released sleep.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard fasting can increase growth hormone.
know certain patterns weight training can increase growth hormone.
regimens weight room increase growth hormone
covered Dr. Duncan French, guest podcast, maybe
refer people episode specific protocols-- high volume training. KYLE
GILLETT: training exercises, usually transiently period
hours. lot IGF-1 released muscle itself. not necessarily
released liver. IGF-1 released directly due growth hormone signaling--
usually, growth hormone comes pituitary binds liver
usually, half life week, paracrine autocrine-- think
like peripherally acting acting muscles itself, also helpful--
released not concerning not related insulin resistance,
related training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fasting growth hormone--
true fasting can increase growth hormone? maybe little related tangent,
heard limiting food intake two hours going sleep can increase
pulse growth hormone one experiences sleep. course, everyone


gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

gets pulse growth hormone sleep, especially carbohydrate-laden meals
can blunt peak occurs sleep quite substantially. two questions--
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep help increase growth hormone
release? Maybe overly neurotic. Maybe people need avoid food four
hours sleep. regardless, relationship fasting growth
hormone release? find really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently
increases growth hormone release. However, IND binding receptor less
sensitive. although fasting increase growth hormone, genes
downstream it-- growth hormone genes IGF-1 related gene transcription
activity-- will not significantly higher. However, optimizing growth
hormone released pulsatile secretion, helpful avoid eating two
hours. general rule thumb avoid eating two hours bed. think
clinically significant helpful. fasting otherwise specifically growth
hormone optimization someone already normal growth hormone signaling
not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: extremely useful hear one
major reasons people fast get growth hormone increase.
adjusting things backend negate that, well, then, no luck. Not
anything fasting. pseudointermittent fasting mostly

01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens

prefer eat fairly regular times day. doesn't sound like lot
people can take supplement form improve growth hormone. thyroid
hormone? things people can take order make sure
thyroid hormone levels appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: want
balance iodine want good source iodine.
camps say use huge high dose iodine protocols it.
say use just barely enough iodine-- believe like
200 micrograms per day. want balance. One things see many
people not talk comes iodine thyroid compounds
known goitrogens. goitrogens neither good evil, actually
kind nice check balance. need iodine consume
goitrogens. examples favorite foods-- cruciferous
vegetables. Boron also goitrogen. higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

HUBERMAN: ingesting iodine containing salt useful? Yes no? KYLE GILLETT:
Iodized salt prevent goiter, not necessarily ideal form iodine. Good
forms iodine often come ocean. look chart hypothyroidism,
tendency hypothyroidism inland go. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: trying eat cruciferous vegetables day best
way improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along plenty iodine. don't
want much iodine signaling. Many people familiar radioactive iodine tablets,
basically extremely high amount iodine block radioactive
iodine comes like nuclear meltdown whatnot. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine,

01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome

allicin garlic offset TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia,
fasting. love talk peptides. can imagine hierarchy. hierarchy
starts behaviors nutrition. Behaviors, course, includes training, limiting
stress, things talked before-- sunshine et cetera-- optimize
nutrition. Then, talked supplements-- things just listed off optimize
testosterone. can get this, estrogen well, important libido,
brain function, tissue function, joints feeling good, et cetera.
get realm one might, consider, exogenous hormones. Get--
taking small dose testosterone taking small dose GH even
appropriate certainly working doctor. between, step so-
called peptides. course, many peptides. already talked
them. people talk taking peptides, ones hear
often category increases GH IGF-1, knowledge go
things like sermorelin sort kit things taken separately
combination increase GH IGF-1. people, instance, taking
peptides like BPC 157 try improve tissue healing recovery. lot
interest peptides. Please, would, tell us know safety
peptides terms sourcing utility peptides. something
people consider thinking hormone replacement? people
wary things? wary particular sources sold online
not clean. contain contaminants dangerous. really love


thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold

thoughts peptides. just going sit back let riff peptides,
touch ones mentioned, grateful. KYLE
GILLETT: peptide just chain amino acids two couple hundred
length. think peptides several different categories. GHRPs
mentioned, consider those-- stands Growth Hormone Releasing
Peptide. two main types-- ghrelin agonist are-- hit ghrelin
receptor, helps release growth hormone that. also
GHRH-like peptides. similar growth hormone releasing hormone.
Often, just change couple amino acids, acts like that. Tesamorelin one
them, sermorelin another one, CJC another common one. believe
class GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin ibutamoren, also
known MK-677, two class ghrelin agonist. like
hit receptor ghrelin whereas ones hit GHRH receptor.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think ghrelin making hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry
angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: want take something
increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: people trying gain weight.
also increase growth hormone. growth hormone low,
can consider it. Ibutamoren long-acting-- long half life, also known MK-
677. well-- studied mostly growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: can. Many
people report side effect anxiety significant hunger. people take
evening don't notice hunger much. can also greatly increase blood
glucose. insulin resistant pre-diabetic, gets especially concerning.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: one rare moments hear something
think, even though kit compounds can increase GH IGF-1,
based everything telling me, maybe just taking GH better option
people, growth hormone, least it's-- synthetic growth hormone
mimicking endogenous hormone. mean, certainly not taking anything might
ideal. want increase growth hormone want use
pharmacology that, sounds like peptides pretty precarious. KYLE
GILLETT: Yeah, kind depends situation. individual struggles
hunger not eating enough-- example, someone small
stomach just low hunger drive, sometimes want
orexigenic signaling. hypothalamus, anorexia signaling, kind


like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

like anorexia, orexigenic signaling, is-- call hangry center
hypothalamus hangry center. imbalance two,
perhaps it'd helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful anorexics, which,
incidence anorexia men increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
telling this, remembering 14 15 years old, go
kitchen sometimes, hungry just obliterate food.
remember being-- always pretty high energy guy, immense
amount energy. can't recall hangry feeling not, guessing
growth hormone. grew one foot single academic year, imagine
least part due growth hormone. case, sermorelin peptide hear
often about. admittedly tried run it. researching book, decided
take sleep empty stomach. gave tremendous depth sleep,
sleep really truncated, just nerd speak saying deep short sleep.
wake intense dreams. can't say helped recover
exercise much. didn't notice additional fat loss anything. Sort abandoned
except occasional use. Again, prescribed doctor. starting get
sense peptides effects somewhat vague, distributed,
highly individual. fair way describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part
problem effect peptides many people take levels far
physiologic range. Even individuals checking IGF-1
take different GHRPs, not check binding peptides--
example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, 3. free IGF-1 level might significantly
different. common doses people will take off-label supplement
often much greater therapeutic physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which, me, just underscores fact pretty precarious. mean, not
coming referee anyone shouldn't do. just trying
gather distribute information. heard, instance, companies
people can acquire things without prescription, companies not
good cleaning lipopolysaccharide-- LPS-- can cause
inflammatory response. words, dirty compounds. just sounds
risky. just sounds-- frankly, just sounds really dangerous me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS
common additive many companies not pharmacies, selling
things people often use human consumption. One interesting note
lipopolysaccharide gut microbiome actually makes lot well, especially


prevotella specific species, can baseline body
temperature. baseline body temperature might also change depending
peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

prevotella specific species, can baseline body

peptide LPS it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[CHUCKLES] tend pretty conservative comes taking anything
exogenous. rely many supplements talked earlier
try optimize behavioral things nutritional things

01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy

long time. leaving peptides behind, now suppose territory
exogenous hormone. say somebody decides not concerned
fertility, going bank sperm, already kids, going
defer issue wanting kids, understanding nowadays, lot
people using testosterone-- not even call replacement therapy,
people 600, 700, even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. not
replacing anything diminished. just trying augment already
there-- increase already there. understanding taking low dose
frequently going beneficial kind old school way giving 100
even 200 milligrams single injection every two weeks. right?
patients? let give hypothetical. Somebody comes
office, blood work, blood levels of, say, 600
nanogram per deciliter testosterone. estrogen also normal range. Everything
else checks out, complaining slightly diminished libido, slightly poor
recovery workouts, maybe reduced motivation drive, although no major
depression. come conclusion testosterone therapy-- not
replacement, testosterone therapy might good option explore.
typical dosage range frequency administration range might consider
exploring? KYLE GILLETT: depends SHBG free
testosterone well. individual high SHBG which, again,
binding protein binds testosterone androgens estrogens,
extremely high free testosterone two, might need
different dose need enough testosterone order normal
eugonadal free testosterone. general normal dosing range, especially someone
starting, around 100 120 milligrams divided course week, usually


either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people

either every day three times week-- occasionally, twice week. Many people
SHBG bit higher can get away pretty easily twice week. assuming
ester cypionate enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: two 60 milligram
injections testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, common
dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hit 120 milligrams per week kind typical
average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. consider like physiologic
eugonadal dose. many people, even 200 milligrams week far
reference range. said caveat testosterone normally released
pulsatile manner. high morning, low evening. Whereas
testosterone therapy, going steady state. testosterone
level going pretty much even evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
experience, patients that, guessing report normal
constellation positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep,
recovery, et cetera. hazards things can crop
bloodwork just subjectively can warning signs even dosage 120
milligrams divided two three dosages per week high? KYLE
GILLETT: Every organ system body. really least
well-versed every organ system, not just gonadal genital system. need
dermatology prowess. Acne common change. Lots different skin
pathologies even bruising can related hormone replacement. Hair loss
common see well. Mental status changes. occasionally even induce
manic bipolar episode testosterone also dopaminergic.
cardiovascularly not just heart, also concerns like microvascular ischemic
disease. Ferritin buildup estrogen also increases. fertility concerns
well lipid concerns too. really hematologist, dermatologist,
cardiologist, lipidologist, whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: another reason--
set reasons rather to, one considering using testosterone therapy, really
close communication really good physician lot monitor.
Knowing whether not acne not one thing, knowing whether not
LDL going up, ApoB going up, whole biz needs
done bloodwork hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
physician managing prescribing testosterone therapy HRT not
well-versed systems, want part



01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,

01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene

interdisciplinary team experts can monitor
systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: skipped sort still intermediate set things--
prescription drugs-- maybe talking testosterone first bit mistake
part aware are-- actually, think companies,
certainly groups say, no, wait-- don't go straight nothing
supplements testosterone. behaviors optimizing nutrition
supplements-- forget peptides-- instead going straight testosterone therapy,
one idea many people pursuing take prescription drugs trigger
luteinizing hormones-- taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin,
understanding will increase testosterone, also estrogen. take things like
clomiphene. fact, think bunch companies now saying
don't take testosterone-- shuts spermatogenesis, shuts testosterone
production-- clomiphene way go. Maybe educate us hCG
monotherapy, think called, just mono-- one-- just taking hCG
clomiphene a-- and/or clomiphene tool ratchet hormones. KYLE GILLETT:
quick points hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made especially
first trimester pregnancy, effects binding LH receptor. also
binds TSH receptor thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thyroid
stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. fact, look molecule hCG
thyroid stimulating hormone, extremely similar. However, need relatively
high dose hCG bind TSH receptor. normal mechanism
pregnancy accounts increased need thyroid hormone-- usually, 30%
40%. someone hypothyroidism, increase dose thyroid,
hCG not going you. Clomid, clomiphene,
two main-- believe diastereomers. one enclomiphene one
zuclomiphene. two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, believe,
faster half life potentially slightly better tolerated. However,
studying it-- Clomid commonly prescribed drug, obviously, plenty
enclomiphene Clomid. However, drug Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-
X-A-L-- not go way FDA approval process despite Clomid
FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Clomid contains clomiphene,
also-- talking male hormone optimization


episode-- males want increase testosterone
hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- opt not take exogenous
testosterone-- no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- decide take
clomiphene couple times week. understanding-- never done this.
say had. understanding taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram
tablets week hear people doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone,
various estrogen receptor subunits? explain clomiphene
benefit anyone, good strategy? hearing done quite lot
now. KYLE GILLETT: will increase testosterone dose dependent manner,
many pharmacodynamic effects, effect drug body
effect hypothalamus pituitary. hypothalamus
pituitary, called negative feedback inhibition blocks action
estrogen. crowds estrogen estrogen receptor hypothalamus
pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: objective effect
cause? understanding experience estrogen ever took--
take low dose aromatase inhibitor felt terrible. Actually
reduced libido, joints felt achy. discovered that, wow, estrogen actually
really important brain function, joint function, libido. suppressing
estrogen, me, just turned wrong idea. levels indicate
within reference range. want take something increase
activity estrogen receptor? just can't find rationale that. KYLE GILLETT:
main rationale behind taking serm temporary measure not
going suppress pituitary hypothalamic function testosterone just
drastically low unlikely recover anyway. time not clinically
useful, serm not prescribed often, certainly not long term
testosterone replacement testosterone optimization individuals.
always exceptions everything. five different estrogen estrogen-related
receptors. two main estrogen receptors. clomid every serm
unique profile selectively inhibit receptors tissues, not
receptors tissues. example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
eye, can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially higher doses.
also acts every tissue body. side effects Clomid
selective estrogen receptor modifiers common. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least--



01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature

mind, going pool peptides say sounds precarious
probably not ideal people. Going back testosterone therapy then-- notice,
folks, deleted replacement part think many people using
testosterone therapy without need to-- sort reference range need replace
anything, rather building already purposes increasing
vitality, et cetera. Going back that, understanding taking hCG several times
per week can help maintain spermatogenesis fertility even people
testosterone. But-- talking earlier-- tremendous
variation. people will take small amount testosterone just crush sperm
count. just won't make viable sperm. people can maintain viable sperm
production testosterone, especially taking hCG. right? KYLE
GILLETT: Correct. many reasons this. heat
damage testes, potentially cold therapy helpful that. And--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, just avoid-- certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT:
Stopping daily hot tub can restore fertility many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
know number people trying conceive children go sauna,
just put cold pack shorts legs depending whether
not wearing shorts not go in. alternate ice heat
way maintains coolness milieu sperm live. words,
cooling scrotum deliberately order avoid killing sperm. Actually, saw
interesting paper said every two degree increase temperature
scrotum, 20% decrease spermatogenesis viability sperm.
actually, look difference people stand lot, sit lot, drive
lot, see progressive decrease sperm count people
sitting, increase temperature, sitting hot seat
car, an-- using heated seats, actually, kills sperm. think
good data that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, anecdotally, see
well. several patients come fertility consultations. like, no
medications, no supplements. change their-- several lifestyle things. tight fitting


clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not

antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

clothing another one. soon, fertility no longer--

01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat

sperm whereas before, not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
like talk do's don'ts, talked lot do's--
things one can optimize hormones. Maybe just sort rapid
fire Q&A don'ts maybe throw science feel
appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes no-- diminishes testosterone levels?
KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, say, diminishes testosterone, increases
prolactin. no. cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD,
not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: edible cannabis THC? KYLE
GILLETT: far know, edible cannabis THC not significantly increase
prolactin point disruptive hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever want call it, increase gynecomastia--
growth male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, certainly can,
pretty good association smoked THC gynecomastia. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: nicotine testosterone estrogen hormones--
smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine particularly concerning not
testosterone, also estrogen. Part is, talking nicotine
tobacco, many carcinogens it, especially smoked. nicotine,
even chewed dose dependent manner-- can use extremely small
amount nicotine, not concerning long run. vasoconstrictor,
one main concerns cardiovascular disease even
microvascular ischemic disease can lead neurodegenerative disease, like
type dementia can partly due nicotine. use nicotine long
period time, especially higher dose, dose-dependent effect hormone
profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: also true Nicorette nicotine gums?
KYLE GILLETT: high doses, can use extremely low dose nicotine gum,
theoretically, maintainable. not going overload nicotinic
receptor. acetylcholine cholinergic system one main nervous
systems, course. muscarinic receptors nicotinic receptors,
just better ways optimize nicotinic receptor activity. example,


acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially part well.
alkaloids. nicotine alkaloid tobacco plant.
plants like cytosine genus plants, alkaloid also nicotine
receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true cycling long-- literally,
bicycling-- sitting bike seat long can damage prostate? KYLE GILLETT:
Yes, can concerning, especially seated cycling, especially
putting lot pressure perineum. core kind like box
diaphragm sort makes top abs serratus make front
sides. back muscles make back, pelvic floor makes bottom
box, arguably important part core. pressure can
weaken even lead incontinence impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
talking earlier today gym heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
kinds things lot guys increase testosterone, done
correctly, can actually augment build strength pelvic floor. Done
incorrectly, can actually weaken pelvic floor lead sorts issues, including
sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. one go learning whether
not movements done properly support pelvic floor destruct pelvic
floor? KYLE GILLETT: pelvic floor constellation muscles just like
kind like system body. form important. valsalva
maneuver, again, bearing deep breath feel
abs tight, can also notice pelvic floor tight well.
history inguinal hernia, hole kind like connecting abdominal cavity
pelvic floor even scrotum cases-- can
sign weakness area, might concentrate most,
even physiotherapist physical therapist specifically target pelvic floor.
Many exercises valsalva use glutes legs, can learn
squeeze mind-muscle connection order help build pelvic
floor. things. Many people familiar kegels. just one
many different exercises can help pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
understanding strengthening pelvic floor good, excessive contraction
pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow pelvic area, penis, forth.
is, again, double-edged sword. mean, don't want guys just
start endless number kegels every day actually going


constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous

also potentially concerns cancer tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go back prostate talk something kind newer
emerging trend. know talked little bit previous podcasts,
number men-- say number physicians prescribing low dose
tadalafil, also known Cialis, male patients. dosage ranges like 2.5
milligrams 5 milligrams per day, not erectile dysfunction, rather
improving prostate health. presumably, get sort boost terms blood
flow genitalia well. again, not specifically deal erectile dysfunction,


deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:
depends age. 20-year-old, likely 0 1. 40-year-
old, likely 1 3. 80-year-old, not abnormal


PSA 5 well within reference range. Another thing
mention PSA take 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride
dutasteride, often will cut PSA half. you-- example,
PSA 6 start finasteride dutasteride,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost
overlooked fact get lot questions drugs offset hair loss.
drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

constrict blood flow area. There's-- fact, erection response
parasympathetic. relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: the-- reason chuckle for--
talking things, don't visuals charts, certainly, hard know
whether not given exercise like kegels going good not good.
excessive, what-- many sets reps take goes good bad.
kind general rule thumb people think this? mean, clearly
blood flow area key sexual performance. yet one trains legs
even walks, getting blood flow. understanding combination
weight training stimulate positive hormonal, muscular, connective
tissue growth key provided not overtraining, casual exercise like walking,
stretching, sorts things will return blood flow area.
overly basic way think will suffice? KYLE GILLETT: think
good way think it. think main point kegels just one many
different things. pelvic floor pathology certainly even just
concerned pelvic floor, don't just take advice kegels OK.
not near enough. just one many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going back rapid Q&A, come back issue blood flow
interesting science protocols there-- question is,
alcohol, increase aromatase, enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen not? dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: significantly
does. dose dependence. general, not recommend three
four standard drinks. One huge glass wine probably five standard drinks.
say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, consistent
discovered researching alcohol episode alcohol. no alcohol
definitely better aspects health alcohol. anyone says that,
well, red wine contains various things, well, doesn't contain enough
positive things positive effect. people opt drink alcohol,
two drinks per week-- meaning 20 grams alcohol, probably two 12 ounce
beers two 4 ounce glasses wine-- going upper limit beyond
going start seeing sorts negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: thing
keep mind alcohol lot calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost
much fat, 9. also GABAergic, can activate inhibitory
neurotransmission, can also affect much LH FSH released.


can also decrease testosterone almost kind similar opiates can decrease
testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: feel lucky don't enjoy alcohol--
never really did. can kind take leave it. certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
anything like that, which, just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. said
word fat, going pick say, order optimize hormone
production, important saturated fat one's diet? happens
low fat diets testosterone, estrogen, steroid hormones? KYLE
GILLETT: Fat interesting many different beneficial fats. Omega
3s-- almost every American gets plenty omega 6s-- developed country really.
comes saturated fat, correlation hormone optimisation.
eating things saturated fat, tend have-- things
fat soluble vitamins things nutrient dense otherwise. not vital.
general, want eliminate trans fat unless trans fat ruminants.
always exception everything. healthy trans omega 3 fats,
formed stomach grass fed finished ruminants. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters limited amounts
calorie dense, but-- unless people trying increase
calories, case, great source calories, small amounts butter, ghee,
probably OK, not excessive amounts? idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat
perfectly fine. Cholesterol interesting-- cholesterol and, general,
phospholipids make bilayer around cell. cholesterol also hormone
binds estrogen-related receptor alpha. consider
like estrogen receptor category, can help metabolism,

02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids

recheck six months 6.5, huge concern,
actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: glad brought almost

drugs going operate DHT system-- dihydrotestosterone
system-- reasons talked before. DHT receptors scalp
causing beard growth face. case number people taking things
like Propecia things block DHT disrupt DHT pathway going
experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation general vigor? if,
alternatives like topical DHT antagonists might use want keep
hair, not negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: way think
hair loss fertilizers, also known growth agonist,
anti-androgens. Whether systemic topical, both,
general laymen's way think hair loss. putting fertilizer
hair androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness, hairs will still
miniaturize, eventually, still loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: great
word-- miniaturize. enough send anybody off find therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT:
way, difficult tell miniaturization happening unless
magnifying glass. can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost didn't know--
second there, didn't know whether not making joke. talking
miniaturization hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
can reverse miniaturization? Gosh, just fun word say. going just
keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: individual has-- again, mentioned androgen
receptor. Males one androgen receptor gene X chromosome.
depending sensitive androgen receptor depending density
receptors hair follicle, can arbitrary threshold. don't
know threshold start miniaturization loss hair.
threshold, follicle will die eventually stem cell will leave.


threshold, OK. Every androgen binds androgen receptor.
nothing special DHT. DHT just stronger androgen. higher
SHBG-- things increase SHBG beneficial hair loss prevention
less binding receptor. think hair loss-- specifically,
androgenic male pattern baldness terms androgen receptor
everything general binding it-- not just DHT, also testosterone-- helpful.
just DHT huge battering ram whereas androgens just light presses
door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting

deal prostate health blood flow prostate. something
sometimes-- often prescribe patients, age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil
underrated medication. age kind depend indication.
tadalafil also blood pressure medication. can slightly decrease blood
pressure, especially higher doses. higher doses, it-- high dose 20
milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. consistently, can somewhat affect cones
eye red green sight. Although, remove it, effect
reversed. basically, don't need really, really good red/green discrimination,
can take higher doses. general, recommend no higher 10 milligrams day--
usually just two 5 milligrams. One benefit use tadalafil
increases density androgen receptor similarly l-carnitine.
interesting benefit. Another benefit give people nocturia,
urinating night general, will cut episodes half. go 2 1,
can make big difference sleep, will secondarily make big
difference growth hormone testosterone optimization. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Interesting. said 2.5 5 milligrams per day typical
prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned potential side effects adjusting visual perception. vision scientist,
rings mind. terms red/green color discrimination, guessing unless
going subject one experiments lab want
fighter pilot, chances can probably get away little less red/green color
discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. not considered clinically significant unless
someone commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT:
someone's getting pilot exam, one things look for. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: commercial pilots aside, might want ask doctor low
dose tadalafil sake enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate
specific antigen important. can give anecdote there. tried sermorelin, one
surprising side effects not welcome dramatic spike prostate
specific antigen. No one explain happen, stopped
taking sermorelin, went back normal. one reason avoid sermorelin,
least, frequent use sermorelin. PSA kept-- what-- levels
somewhere 1 4 considered healthy? right? KYLE GILLETT:

door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. topical DHT receptor
antagonists going better choice people want maintain hair grow
hair want avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. individuals
benefit systemic-- systemic decrease DHT couple reasons. One
prostate one actually hypertrophy myocardium. DHT also
disproportionately thickens ventricle. someone TRT, might benefit
prone thickening ventricle baseline. However, many people
just bit predisposition, can use things topical anti-androgens.
Ketoconazole one them, caffeine actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
going say hair tends grow pretty fast, might be-- drink lot
caffeine. topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- it-- wait,
explain works? people get caffeine hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT:
Topically, caffeine enters scalp crowds out-- somewhat crowds
androgen. weak effect. likely just strong enough clinically significant.
Usually, caffeine put formulations things like ketoconazole also
weak anti-androgens. note, spironolactone can prescribed topically,
absorbed systemically size molecule. unless doctor
specifically prescribes you, especially male, not use topical
spironolactone. Topical finasteride also smaller molecule, also systemically
absorbed, not extremely well systemically absorbed. take topical
finasteride, usually systemic DHT will decrease 30%. Topical
dutasteride likely tiny bit systemically absorbed, unique half life
much faster lower dose. topical dutasteride will not affect systemic DHT
all, seen anecdotally many people topical dutasteride therapy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: going get back episode


DHT, hair loss, hair growth. Again, not topic focus lot
myself, get lot questions men women. KYLE GILLETT:
One thing mention-- got ton questions turmeric
curcuminoids last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, reported
anecdotal experience taking turmeric really crushed DHT levels
not feel good. mean, crushed sorts positive feelings vitality. moment
stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this.
interesting thing turmeric beneficial action-- not it--
people benefit systemic turmeric. people can tolerate it-- well,
actually great prostate. action, not need bioavailable.
acts gut microbiome. can take turmeric, not absorbed--
turmeric put special formulations like micellar, liposomal, complexed. lot
put black pepper fruit extract, also known bioperine,
actually also 5-alpha reductase inhibitor affects liver cytochrome. many
supplement companies put black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- almost
everything. people really high doses, also making
effect people not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, avoid turmeric like plague based one previous experience
clearly turmeric caused negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed
rapidly. bioperine-- black pepper extract-- also avoid like plague
based everything just said. want 5-alpha reductase, want DHT
optimized simply understanding DHT powerful androgen
one that-- yes, causes little bit hair loss got patches
there, willing live based wonderful things DHT
optimization does. quickly mention things. One, saw palmetto also 5-
alpha reductase inhibitor, couple isoenzymes. three main
isoenzymes, lot problem inhibiting couple isoenzymes,
not one. Finasteride inhibits 1 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits three.
finasteride inhibits isoenzyme genital skin, not skin
throughout rest body. lot side effects finasteride, loss
sensation loss erectile function, disconcordance
sensitivity genital skin skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another
reason not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. definitely get back talk
about-- think just whole episode DHT, often


people thinking optimizing hormones, especially males trying optimize
hormones, thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, think
little bit free testosterone maybe think estrogen also
important-- not crush estrogen. DHT is, least mind, linchpin

02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health

many things subjectively people really focused on-- libido,
motivation, drive, et cetera. one final question-- just brief one, many us
heard BPAs present plastic bottles even certain
aluminum cans phthalates-- difficult word pronounce, fun one
nonetheless-- phthalates-- work Dr. Shanna Swan shown phthalate
exposure fetus-- pregnant mothers fetuses likely negatively
impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, even changing genitalia size
worse males nowadays. saw beautiful lecture Dr. Shanna Swan
Copenhagen. clear negatively impacting male
fetus. also Joe Rogan's podcast. hope get podcast. However,
couldn't answer whether not phthalates, BPAs,
things present plastics, people claim tap water, bad males
born puberty. thoughts on-- just ask you,
drink water plastic bottles? avoid drinking cans not
specifically non-BPA containing cans? actively avoid phthalates?
understanding phthalates enriched pesticides,
seeing dramatic drops sperm testosterone levels mainly rural areas
dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. avoid drinking cans that--
plastics may BPA bisphenol them. Bisphenol known bind
consider fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
consider xenoestrogen. phytoestrogens estrogens plants,
general, not concerning clinically significant. xenoestrogens just
estrogens. avoid BPA also test water. use water testing service
test water filter tap water two boys drink
almost every day. interesting. found one microplastic just bit
reference range, wasn't terrible tap score. even developed countries,
widely variable. far phthalates, again, difficult interesting


pronounce, remember learning believe lawsuit
mac cheese. probably five years ago, coming
list of-- provider obstetrics list avoid
pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats high mercury fish like swordfish salmon,
actually added processed mac cheese list. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Interesting. Well, thank that. going extract statement avoid
drinking plastic bottles possible. guessing not neurotically
attached that. dying thirst, might crack plastic bottle water
survive. listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank much. gave us enormous
wealth knowledge, everything behaviors, psychology, supplementation,
prescription drugs. will make sure point people can get hold
Instagram, Twitter, websites show note captions. really,
just behalf audience just myself, thank much.
immense amount knowledge exquisitely good sharing people
actionable way. thank you. KYLE GILLETT: pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
