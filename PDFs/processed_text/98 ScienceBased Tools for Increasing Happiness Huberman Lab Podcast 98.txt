Things like word happiness, joy, meaning, pleasure, delight, actually

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release
neurons. Things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
epinephrine. Neuromodulators neurotransmitters always present cocktail

need completely discard idea one neurotransmitter one
neuromodulator solely responsible state happiness lack state
happiness, matter. said, true people tend lower
baseline levels of, instance, dopamine, levels happiness, say
self-reported levels happiness, tend lower greatly
elevated baseline levels dopamine. Now, can best appreciated extremes
where, instance, conditions like Parkinson's disease conditions
people's levels dopamine brain severely depleted. Mind you, also see
drug-addicted individuals withdrawal state trying

no one single chemical chemical signature, is, no specific recipe two
parts dopamine, one part serotonin, one part acetylcholine can say equates

emerged conversation.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night
nurses trouble sleeping will literally allow sleep
take care child middle night. Often give excellent care. One hopes
excellent care. won't offset stress associated lack sleep.
million different examples one give this, certainly experienced
graduate school. fact, experience sides equation here. made
little money graduate student. essentially no savings started
graduate school, made little money. amount doesn't matter point,
just barely afford rent food. actually opted live laboratory

important me. Now not family time, able that.
Something not everyone can do. made little money, time,
laboratory time, wanted be. level

thing knew eventually help bring resources. moved
graduate student postdoc, instance. postdoc generally three
five-year period. sort like residency medicine, no longer taking
courses, continue research. fact, entire new lines research prior
getting professorship. income went slightly, went 30% 40%.
moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,
absolute income relative cost living. thing one needs consider
considering income versus cost living also notion peer group.
going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended
aggregate farmer's market Saturday. people wouldn't even purchase
anything, least not graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. just
place aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games soccer just hang
cup coffee. volleyball game Fridays. Sometimes people
go eat evening, course, costs money, et cetera, relatively
low cost living. social connections peer group interactions generated
around fairly low-cost activities. transitioned postdoc, made
money, cost living went up. addition that, peer group tended
want engage kinds activities people larger city
engaged in. peer group tremendously powerful influence whether not
gauge amount money bringing us happiness not.
really speaks critical importance social interactions certain kinds social
interactions, particular. Now, unclear, basically saying
not just able pay rent. also able access kinds
social interactions deem quote-unquote correct stage life
place happen living. can meet
demands costs rent paying power bill food, et cetera,
socially isolated peer group, around want engage
with, engaging activities either don't time for, literally,
things don't financial resources for, can
actually severely impact rating call happiness. parsing
finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard
outcome study Harvard short-term studies, also many
Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not


necessarily scale income. fact, tends not past certain level, yet think
remiss, think actually inappropriate say amount
income one makes not important. amount money
happen making not allow meet basic needs shelter,
health care, et cetera. And/or doesn't allow access kind social interactions

systems hormones lead us feel happy life

statement made earlier, is, indeed, money cannot buy happiness, certainly
can buffer stress. one ways buffers stress allowing options
different kinds social interactions. Options different types recreation one can
engage access new forms social interaction on. need
little bit careful least nuanced statement money can't buy

think truth another side that, think less often
acknowledged

00:37:20 Work, Sense Meaning & Happiness

certainly experienced think many probably
experienced well. One major finding Harvard longitudinal study

perhaps no one deathbed says wish worked more, well
indeed, total amount time one spends working not seem determine
one's happiness. yet also want earmark result one need parse
bit carefully. work, last time checked certainly me, way
typically people earn income. just talked moment ago, income
often way people access provide access family things like
recreation opens opportunity social connection, right.
careful interpret blanket statements become
popular money doesn't determine happiness amount work isn't
going determine happiness. certainly case earn money

care children, care yourself, recreation, things enjoy, well
think little bit naive assume work somehow counter happiness.
Which, course, isn't. especially isn't combine feature work

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote
happiness life people opt not children least happy report
least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether
not people children not. happen find children animals

taking good care children best take good care
children. stance. course, entitled stance


this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth

something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling

sold rate greater. think one indirect measure
whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health

course, things imagine relate lack happiness.

things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported

much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point

notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind

unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness

allogrooming. talking number different things one can

Things like word happiness, joy, meaning, pleasure, delight, actually
not precise comes describing brain body states. So, instance,


tell feeling pretty happy. know means me, least

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release
neurons. Things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
epinephrine. Neuromodulators neurotransmitters always present cocktail
brain body. is, present different ratios different levels.
need completely discard idea one neurotransmitter one
neuromodulator solely responsible state happiness lack state
happiness, matter. said, true people tend lower
baseline levels of, instance, dopamine, levels happiness, say
self-reported levels happiness, tend lower greatly
elevated baseline levels dopamine. Now, can best appreciated extremes
where, instance, conditions like Parkinson's disease conditions
people's levels dopamine brain severely depleted. Mind you, also see
drug-addicted individuals withdrawal state trying


quit don't access drug normally stimulates release dopamine.
Think cocaine addict can't get cocaine. methamphetamine addict
can't trying avoid taking methamphetamine. Parkinson's patient

depressed. tend lower affect. less happy. least,

extreme happiness even euphoria. Sometimes even inappropriate euphoria,
case bipolar depression sometimes called bipolar mania bipolar disorder. Now,
course, range depressed manic. people,
fortunately reside somewhere range. indeed continuum. think
safe say levels dopamine probably correlate levels happiness.
no one single chemical chemical signature, is, no specific recipe two
parts dopamine, one part serotonin, one part acetylcholine can say equates
happiness. Indeed now tremendous controversy whether not,
instance, lower levels serotonin actually cause depression merely
correlates depression maybe doesn't even correlate depression, all.
became especially controversial because, last year, so-called serotonin

Prozac Zoloft, et cetera, still considered excellent treatments conditions

First all, language not great indicator internal state. Especially trying
understand people's internal state. especially true things like

tend chronically low individual typical baseline, will, yes,

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-

et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous

able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally

described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not

look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating

think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.

comparing peers terribly much. might little bit

rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes

people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported

much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-

written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma

again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things

one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working

supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles

passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create

So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history

emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings

increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

emphasizing confirmed me, fact language.
Things like word happiness, joy, meaning, pleasure, delight, actually
not precise comes describing brain body states. So, instance,


tell feeling pretty happy. know means me, least

happy means you. say extremely happy big grin. grin

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release
neurons. Things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
epinephrine. Neuromodulators neurotransmitters always present cocktail
brain body. is, present different ratios different levels.
need completely discard idea one neurotransmitter one
neuromodulator solely responsible state happiness lack state
happiness, matter. said, true people tend lower
baseline levels of, instance, dopamine, levels happiness, say
self-reported levels happiness, tend lower greatly
elevated baseline levels dopamine. Now, can best appreciated extremes
where, instance, conditions like Parkinson's disease conditions
people's levels dopamine brain severely depleted. Mind you, also see
drug-addicted individuals withdrawal state trying


quit don't access drug normally stimulates release dopamine.
Think cocaine addict can't get cocaine. methamphetamine addict

course, range depressed manic. people,
fortunately reside somewhere range. indeed continuum. think
safe say levels dopamine probably correlate levels happiness.
no one single chemical chemical signature, is, no specific recipe two
parts dopamine, one part serotonin, one part acetylcholine can say equates

instance, lower levels serotonin actually cause depression merely
correlates depression maybe doesn't even correlate depression, all.

First all, language not great indicator internal state. Especially trying

lot power study like this. basic takeaways,

still intact memory, many do, able think back not
just previous year week 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago
compare makes happy one age versus another age. number things
emerged conversation.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night
nurses trouble sleeping will literally allow sleep
take care child middle night. Often give excellent care. One hopes
excellent care. won't offset stress associated lack sleep.
million different examples one give this, certainly experienced
graduate school. fact, experience sides equation here. made
little money graduate student. essentially no savings started
graduate school, made little money. amount doesn't matter point,
just barely afford rent food. actually opted live laboratory
lot time. that, money spend things
important me. Now not family time, able that.
Something not everyone can do. made little money, time,
laboratory time, wanted be. level
stress actually pretty low investing time energy
thing knew eventually help bring resources. moved
graduate student postdoc, instance. postdoc generally three
five-year period. sort like residency medicine, no longer taking
courses, continue research. fact, entire new lines research prior
getting professorship. income went slightly, went 30% 40%.
moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,
absolute income relative cost living. thing one needs consider
considering income versus cost living also notion peer group.
going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended
aggregate farmer's market Saturday. people wouldn't even purchase
anything, least not graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. just
place aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games soccer just hang
cup coffee. volleyball game Fridays. Sometimes people
go eat evening, course, costs money, et cetera, relatively
low cost living. social connections peer group interactions generated
around fairly low-cost activities. transitioned postdoc, made
money, cost living went up. addition that, peer group tended
want engage kinds activities people larger city
engaged in. peer group tremendously powerful influence whether not
gauge amount money bringing us happiness not.
really speaks critical importance social interactions certain kinds social
interactions, particular. Now, unclear, basically saying
not just able pay rent. also able access kinds
social interactions deem quote-unquote correct stage life
place happen living. can meet
demands costs rent paying power bill food, et cetera,
socially isolated peer group, around want engage
with, engaging activities either don't time for, literally,
things don't financial resources for, can
actually severely impact rating call happiness. parsing
finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard
outcome study Harvard short-term studies, also many
Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not


necessarily scale income. fact, tends not past certain level, yet think
remiss, think actually inappropriate say amount
income one makes not important. amount money
happen making not allow meet basic needs shelter,
health care, et cetera. And/or doesn't allow access kind social interactions
can renew reset or, say, directly enhance kind neurotransmitter
systems hormones lead us feel happy life
quality social connections, well stressful. brings back
statement made earlier, is, indeed, money cannot buy happiness, certainly
can buffer stress. one ways buffers stress allowing options
different kinds social interactions. Options different types recreation one can
engage access new forms social interaction on. need
little bit careful least nuanced statement money can't buy
happiness data support fact wealth doesn't determine happiness.
think truth another side that, think less often
acknowledged

00:37:20 Work, Sense Meaning & Happiness

certainly experienced think many probably
experienced well. One major finding Harvard longitudinal study
happiness, well shorter-term studies happiness, much heard,
perhaps no one deathbed says wish worked more, well
indeed, total amount time one spends working not seem determine
one's happiness. yet also want earmark result one need parse
bit carefully. work, last time checked certainly me, way
typically people earn income. just talked moment ago, income
often way people access provide access family things like
recreation opens opportunity social connection, right.
careful interpret blanket statements become
popular money doesn't determine happiness amount work isn't
going determine happiness. certainly case earn money
working money devoted things bring opportunities
social connection buffering stress areas life, including health care,


care children, care yourself, recreation, things enjoy, well
think little bit naive assume work somehow counter happiness.
Which, course, isn't. especially isn't combine feature work
another important feature human psyche, notion meaning. Now
not-too-distant future, will episode podcast meaning
constitutes meaning given endeavor, work otherwise. much psychology
last century, still today, focuses feature meaning critical one
terms makes us happy doesn't make us happy, certainly long

consider work simply way gain paycheck, people find

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote
happiness life people opt not children least happy report
least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether
not people children not. happen find children animals
delightful. always happy people opt children provided
taking good care children best take good care
children. stance. course, entitled stance


this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth
rates, et cetera. Indeed many areas world, birth rates going down. actually
something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling
rate years ago whether not adult diapers elderly
sold rate greater. think one indirect measure
whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness
certainly overall health. think zero question smoking increases cancers
different kinds. alcohol consumption. particular, alcohol consumption
beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks typical volume beer,

00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident



glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number
different things. check episode Dr. Paul Conti like learn
trauma manifests. idea put forth number

gain wealth, right. Buying lottery ticket pretty quick thing. Inheritance
something simply get virtue are, not necessarily effort. Well,
led increases self-reported happiness compared prior inheritance

notion happiness simply from, well, money equals happiness.
true people rendered paraplegic undergo psychological

certainly true one year trauma. point need
reframe idea whether not win lottery become paraplegic suffer

not accurate even initial study. think important thing frame

become happy again. idea already explored not necessarily true.
Frankly, knew lot teenagers people early 20s pretty unhappy

honest, sometimes distance family origin makes us happy,
sometimes less so. highly individual. think general themes

powerful longitudinal short-term studies, nuance, cases,

01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things
can can allow us so-called synthesize happiness. think
one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working
happiness US world, frankly. One great gifts
supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian

particularly interesting one explored different types music

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still

environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing

things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come

snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick

wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind

unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes

fact, time, don't even really know feel.
statement meant report several different things way brain
works emotions, et cetera, one things emphasizing, know
emphasizing confirmed me, fact language.
Things like word happiness, joy, meaning, pleasure, delight, actually
not precise comes describing brain body states. So, instance,


tell feeling pretty happy. know means me, least

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release
neurons. Things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
epinephrine. Neuromodulators neurotransmitters always present cocktail
brain body. is, present different ratios different levels.
need completely discard idea one neurotransmitter one
neuromodulator solely responsible state happiness lack state
happiness, matter. said, true people tend lower
baseline levels of, instance, dopamine, levels happiness, say
self-reported levels happiness, tend lower greatly
elevated baseline levels dopamine. Now, can best appreciated extremes
where, instance, conditions like Parkinson's disease conditions
people's levels dopamine brain severely depleted. Mind you, also see
drug-addicted individuals withdrawal state trying


quit don't access drug normally stimulates release dopamine.
Think cocaine addict can't get cocaine. methamphetamine addict
can't trying avoid taking methamphetamine. Parkinson's patient

case bipolar depression sometimes called bipolar mania bipolar disorder. Now,
course, range depressed manic. people,
fortunately reside somewhere range. indeed continuum. think
safe say levels dopamine probably correlate levels happiness.
no one single chemical chemical signature, is, no specific recipe two
parts dopamine, one part serotonin, one part acetylcholine can say equates
happiness. Indeed now tremendous controversy whether not,
instance, lower levels serotonin actually cause depression merely
correlates depression maybe doesn't even correlate depression, all.

First all, language not great indicator internal state. Especially trying

tend chronically low individual typical baseline, will, yes,

And, particular, controlled experiments

00:26:32 Harvard Happiness Project

individuals come laboratory. participate experiment course
day months. then, data collected analyzed, papers submitted,
published, discussed. form so-called longitudinal study.
individuals come laboratory, studied long period
time. Ranging months years sometimes even decades. then,

typically, multiple papers, data published throughout

lot power study like this. basic takeaways,

still intact memory, many do, able think back not
just previous year week 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago
compare makes happy one age versus another age. number things
emerged conversation.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night
nurses trouble sleeping will literally allow sleep
take care child middle night. Often give excellent care. One hopes
excellent care. won't offset stress associated lack sleep.
million different examples one give this, certainly experienced
graduate school. fact, experience sides equation here. made
little money graduate student. essentially no savings started
graduate school, made little money. amount doesn't matter point,
just barely afford rent food. actually opted live laboratory
lot time. that, money spend things
important me. Now not family time, able that.
Something not everyone can do. made little money, time,
laboratory time, wanted be. level
stress actually pretty low investing time energy
thing knew eventually help bring resources. moved
graduate student postdoc, instance. postdoc generally three
five-year period. sort like residency medicine, no longer taking
courses, continue research. fact, entire new lines research prior
getting professorship. income went slightly, went 30% 40%.
moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,
absolute income relative cost living. thing one needs consider
considering income versus cost living also notion peer group.
going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended
aggregate farmer's market Saturday. people wouldn't even purchase
anything, least not graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. just
place aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games soccer just hang
cup coffee. volleyball game Fridays. Sometimes people
go eat evening, course, costs money, et cetera, relatively
low cost living. social connections peer group interactions generated
around fairly low-cost activities. transitioned postdoc, made
money, cost living went up. addition that, peer group tended
want engage kinds activities people larger city
engaged in. peer group tremendously powerful influence whether not
gauge amount money bringing us happiness not.
really speaks critical importance social interactions certain kinds social
interactions, particular. Now, unclear, basically saying
not just able pay rent. also able access kinds
social interactions deem quote-unquote correct stage life
place happen living. can meet
demands costs rent paying power bill food, et cetera,
socially isolated peer group, around want engage
with, engaging activities either don't time for, literally,
things don't financial resources for, can
actually severely impact rating call happiness. parsing
finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard
outcome study Harvard short-term studies, also many
Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not


necessarily scale income. fact, tends not past certain level, yet think
remiss, think actually inappropriate say amount
income one makes not important. amount money
happen making not allow meet basic needs shelter,
health care, et cetera. And/or doesn't allow access kind social interactions
can renew reset or, say, directly enhance kind neurotransmitter
systems hormones lead us feel happy life
quality social connections, well stressful. brings back
statement made earlier, is, indeed, money cannot buy happiness, certainly
can buffer stress. one ways buffers stress allowing options
different kinds social interactions. Options different types recreation one can
engage access new forms social interaction on. need
little bit careful least nuanced statement money can't buy
happiness data support fact wealth doesn't determine happiness.
think truth another side that, think less often
acknowledged

00:37:20 Work, Sense Meaning & Happiness

certainly experienced think many probably
experienced well. One major finding Harvard longitudinal study
happiness, well shorter-term studies happiness, much heard,
perhaps no one deathbed says wish worked more, well
indeed, total amount time one spends working not seem determine
one's happiness. yet also want earmark result one need parse
bit carefully. work, last time checked certainly me, way
typically people earn income. just talked moment ago, income
often way people access provide access family things like
recreation opens opportunity social connection, right.
careful interpret blanket statements become
popular money doesn't determine happiness amount work isn't
going determine happiness. certainly case earn money
working money devoted things bring opportunities
social connection buffering stress areas life, including health care,


care children, care yourself, recreation, things enjoy, well
think little bit naive assume work somehow counter happiness.
Which, course, isn't. especially isn't combine feature work
another important feature human psyche, notion meaning. Now
not-too-distant future, will episode podcast meaning

last century, still today, focuses feature meaning critical one
terms makes us happy doesn't make us happy, certainly long

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

this. also general arguments people like whether not

notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,

general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,

things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic

psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least

perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,

postdoc laboratory first started lab love

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn

also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.

environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.

different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not

wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact

feel right now. said, think us can appreciate immense value
social connection long lasting, lack better word, richer
type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic
partners. reason, want emphasize little bit constitutes
connection constitutes social connection. basically two forms
social connection studied review both, relates increasing
levels happiness. first one presence eye contact, second
physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies
whether not people exchange direct eye contact conversation not,
dictating whether not individual interaction feels
connection. Now again, keep mind think connection relating


deep meaningful conversation, oftentimes can case. Think
instance, excellent therapist patient relationship. excellent romantic
relationship. excellent friendship really feel heard understood,
least extent people willing explore certain topics you. willing
hear listen really carefully saying, willing hear
listen saying attempt understand. certainly can enhance
sense social connection leading people call social bonds leading
increased happiness. eye contact also known important feature.
thing eye contact people assume lot eye contact, fact,
ongoing eye contact, critical sense connection. fact, not case.
recent paper find really interesting published Proceedings

breaking attention. ramping attention braking attention.
Ramping attention braking attention. think important results
violate stereotype assumption deep social connection
sort leading happiness always involves ongoing eye contact ongoing focus. Just
meditation, just activity, frankly, undergo shifts attention

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release
neurons. Things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
epinephrine. Neuromodulators neurotransmitters always present cocktail

need completely discard idea one neurotransmitter one
neuromodulator solely responsible state happiness lack state
happiness, matter. said, true people tend lower
baseline levels of, instance, dopamine, levels happiness, say
self-reported levels happiness, tend lower greatly
elevated baseline levels dopamine. Now, can best appreciated extremes
where, instance, conditions like Parkinson's disease conditions
people's levels dopamine brain severely depleted. Mind you, also see
drug-addicted individuals withdrawal state trying

Think cocaine addict can't get cocaine. methamphetamine addict

anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report

money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-

et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.

able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally

described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not

obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating

test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit

rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes

people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported

much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-

written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma

again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things

one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working

supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles

passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

basis things like tritones things understood mathematics

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce

emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings

gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

imagine people probably haven't heard allogrooming. reason
bringing alogrooming stems fairly extensive literature

seeing dog brief amount time shown reduce stress improve

soothing object. was, least me, little bit counterintuitive.
thought children receiving soothing object powerful

02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness

allogrooming. talking number different things one can

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night

moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,

going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended

finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not

course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether

this. also general arguments people like whether not

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health

glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied

written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma

again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things

one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working

supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,

things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic

psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

basis things like tritones things understood mathematics

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music

took form so-called happiness inventories, right. can focusing
things one grateful for, things particularly enjoy. somewhat
gratitude-type practice includes features well focused
things bring meaning actually engaging things bring
meaning. trying think improve levels happiness,
research essentially says smart try adjust home
environment, adjust work environment cheerful you. Maybe
means plant. me, laboratory, one things really critical
postdoc laboratory first started lab love
aquaria. multiple fish tanks. fact, people laboratory always rolling
eyes. fish tanks these-- like freshwater
tanks, not saltwater tanks, reasons aren't interesting discussion.
freshwater tanks discus fish, instance, me, just beautiful. make

instance, using music using background sound find pleasant
combined concerted effort part create states happiness hopefully

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn
interesting important sources creating so-called synthetic happiness.
also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.
realize word synthetic probably draws connotations false happiness

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

Hence, treatments aimed alleviating depression mania target

talking performance resources relates natural happiness, not

income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes

people will perfectly happy making $1 absolute cost living

00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters

describing emotions states mind body. Now equally important
understand neurotransmitters, is, chemicals
released neurons, nerve cells allow neurons communicate, things like
glutamate gaba, instance. called modulators.
chemicals also released neurons impact electrical firing chemical release

no one single chemical chemical signature, is, no specific recipe two
parts dopamine, one part serotonin, one part acetylcholine can say equates

00:26:32 Harvard Happiness Project

done excellent laboratories focused psychology happiness
brings happiness not. excellent studies
happiness. come two forms generally. One form studies
individuals come laboratory. participate experiment course
day months. then, data collected analyzed, papers submitted,
published, discussed. form so-called longitudinal study.
individuals come laboratory, studied long period
time. Ranging months years sometimes even decades. then,
variables age, life circumstances, factors can incorporated data.
typically, multiple papers, data published throughout
longitudinal study, sometimes just one paper end longitudinal study.
talk one famous perhaps longest-running longitudinal


study happiness. study initiated conceived 1938 Harvard
University. so-called Harvard Happiness Project. probably heard
this. involved Harvard College sophomores individuals
incorporated study well. study initially couple
hundred subjects. either dropped not able
contacted monitored time died, whatever reason, no longer
participating study, individuals left. yet
tremendous power study like this. impressive study,
grateful laboratories Harvard decided initiate continue study
one studies, perhaps study allowed us understand
happiness species long period time. Like study, not perfect.
didn't include lot matching sex matching vocation, matching income
background. back then, also lot less discussion trauma
histories around trauma, well positive episodes people's lives. Nonetheless,
lot power study like this. basic takeaways,
may heard may surprising
haven't. one key things study people study, least
still intact memory, many do, able think back not
just previous year week 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago
compare makes happy one age versus another age. number things
emerged conversation.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night
nurses trouble sleeping will literally allow sleep
take care child middle night. Often give excellent care. One hopes
excellent care. won't offset stress associated lack sleep.
million different examples one give this, certainly experienced
graduate school. fact, experience sides equation here. made
little money graduate student. essentially no savings started
graduate school, made little money. amount doesn't matter point,
just barely afford rent food. actually opted live laboratory
lot time. that, money spend things
important me. Now not family time, able that.
Something not everyone can do. made little money, time,
laboratory time, wanted be. level
stress actually pretty low investing time energy
thing knew eventually help bring resources. moved
graduate student postdoc, instance. postdoc generally three
five-year period. sort like residency medicine, no longer taking
courses, continue research. fact, entire new lines research prior
getting professorship. income went slightly, went 30% 40%.
moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,
absolute income relative cost living. thing one needs consider
considering income versus cost living also notion peer group.
going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended
aggregate farmer's market Saturday. people wouldn't even purchase
anything, least not graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. just
place aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games soccer just hang
cup coffee. volleyball game Fridays. Sometimes people
go eat evening, course, costs money, et cetera, relatively
low cost living. social connections peer group interactions generated
around fairly low-cost activities. transitioned postdoc, made
money, cost living went up. addition that, peer group tended
want engage kinds activities people larger city
engaged in. peer group tremendously powerful influence whether not
gauge amount money bringing us happiness not.
really speaks critical importance social interactions certain kinds social
interactions, particular. Now, unclear, basically saying
not just able pay rent. also able access kinds
social interactions deem quote-unquote correct stage life
place happen living. can meet
demands costs rent paying power bill food, et cetera,
socially isolated peer group, around want engage
with, engaging activities either don't time for, literally,
things don't financial resources for, can
actually severely impact rating call happiness. parsing
finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard
outcome study Harvard short-term studies, also many
Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not


necessarily scale income. fact, tends not past certain level, yet think
remiss, think actually inappropriate say amount
income one makes not important. amount money
happen making not allow meet basic needs shelter,
health care, et cetera. And/or doesn't allow access kind social interactions
can renew reset or, say, directly enhance kind neurotransmitter
systems hormones lead us feel happy life
quality social connections, well stressful. brings back
statement made earlier, is, indeed, money cannot buy happiness, certainly
can buffer stress. one ways buffers stress allowing options
different kinds social interactions. Options different types recreation one can
engage access new forms social interaction on. need
little bit careful least nuanced statement money can't buy
happiness data support fact wealth doesn't determine happiness.
think truth another side that, think less often
acknowledged

00:37:20 Work, Sense Meaning & Happiness

certainly experienced think many probably
experienced well. One major finding Harvard longitudinal study
happiness, well shorter-term studies happiness, much heard,
perhaps no one deathbed says wish worked more, well
indeed, total amount time one spends working not seem determine
one's happiness. yet also want earmark result one need parse
bit carefully. work, last time checked certainly me, way
typically people earn income. just talked moment ago, income
often way people access provide access family things like
recreation opens opportunity social connection, right.
careful interpret blanket statements become
popular money doesn't determine happiness amount work isn't
going determine happiness. certainly case earn money
working money devoted things bring opportunities
social connection buffering stress areas life, including health care,


care children, care yourself, recreation, things enjoy, well
think little bit naive assume work somehow counter happiness.
Which, course, isn't. especially isn't combine feature work
another important feature human psyche, notion meaning. Now
not-too-distant future, will episode podcast meaning
constitutes meaning given endeavor, work otherwise. much psychology
last century, still today, focuses feature meaning critical one
terms makes us happy doesn't make us happy, certainly long
term. can certainly say learning teaching, research
laboratory brings tremendous feeling meaning happiness. people
consider work simply way gain paycheck, people find
work regardless whether not paid. fact,
many people will volunteer work forms work zero money. idea
money isn't important work not important deem be, also
needs considered number different perspectives. again, no
means trying undermine data impressive studies,
longitudinal short-term studies, think cautious
discussion

00:40:13 Toolkit General Wellbeing

going amount time able open thinking creativity,

particular, one's ability stay mobile able access kind daily activities

something will return little bit later terms trying understand periods

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote
happiness life people opt not children least happy report
least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether
not people children not. happen find children animals
delightful. always happy people opt children provided
taking good care children best take good care
children. stance. course, entitled stance


this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth
rates, et cetera. Indeed many areas world, birth rates going down. actually
something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling
rate years ago whether not adult diapers elderly
sold rate greater. think one indirect measure
whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

reporting feeling far less happy happiness returning them, is, rising

find stressful, certainly can run counter happiness. Nowadays,
imagine number people opting perhaps work less not

bump bottom u among decided simply not take
additional responsibilities. interesting test,

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness
certainly overall health. think zero question smoking increases cancers
different kinds. alcohol consumption. particular, alcohol consumption
beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks typical volume beer,

00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident



glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number
different things. check episode Dr. Paul Conti like learn

discussion happened subsequently. hope Dr. Gilbert will interpret
communicating now not attempt criticize rather attempt
praise willingness try correct narrative accurate.
clear study didn't show. here, going combine

major trauma, instance. Not necessarily becoming paraplegic traumas
different sort, emotional traumas. look whole data, least,
read people win lottery acquire wealth inheritance,
form wealth acquisition sudden wasn't preceded specific effort
gain wealth, right. Buying lottery ticket pretty quick thing. Inheritance
something simply get virtue are, not necessarily effort. Well,
led increases self-reported happiness compared prior inheritance
lottery win, wasn't substantial might imagine approaching


notion happiness simply from, well, money equals happiness.
true people rendered paraplegic undergo psychological

resilient many cases. can still manage go life work engage

certainly true one year trauma. point need
reframe idea whether not win lottery become paraplegic suffer
major trauma, levels happiness going three months
year later. don't think accurate. fact, Dr. Dan Gilbert emphasized
not accurate even initial study. think important thing frame
popular notion. idea combined idea
increased earnings don't make us happy combined idea happy early
life demands arise life, become less happy,
become happy again. idea already explored not necessarily true.
Frankly, knew lot teenagers people early 20s pretty unhappy
become happier later acquire resources. Sometimes distance,
honest, sometimes distance family origin makes us happy,
sometimes less so. highly individual. think general themes
heard over, merit certainly stand
powerful longitudinal short-term studies, nuance, cases,

supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us

gifts will bring level joy happiness. small child example,
general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,
young adulthood, adulthood. quite understandably come
associate feeling joy happiness receiving things acquisition
things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn

environment on. really determine needed
best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods

finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not

this. also general arguments people like whether not

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health

glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-

important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational

Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions

gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists

way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking

expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way

really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus

receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods

finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard

Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote

least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether

this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth

something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling

whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic

passive one sit back imagine happy

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music

one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning

wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant

thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not

imagine people probably haven't heard allogrooming. reason
bringing alogrooming stems fairly extensive literature

seeing dog brief amount time shown reduce stress improve

02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness

allogrooming. talking number different things one can
order increase levels happiness. certainly, conclude today,
going touch back not just synthetic happiness various things can do,
prosocial spending, allogrooming, social connection, et cetera. also things
related happiness involve focus vocation work pursuit goals.

talking performance resources relates natural happiness, not

income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes

people will perfectly happy making $1 absolute cost living

still intact memory, many do, able think back not
just previous year week 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago
compare makes happy one age versus another age. number things
emerged conversation.

00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group

just want discuss highlight points get little bit
nitty-gritty data. First all, discussed many, many times total
amount income individual makes has, again, income
work, money inherited, not seem directly relate
level happiness. Now lot people take point think, oh, money doesn't
matter. people hear point think themselves, yeah, right, easy say
lot money. talk interpretation data just
minutes. want earmark finding. agree money total
resources not predict happiness kind direct way, not
thing saying resources will make happier, course. don't think


anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods
services, particular services. not going tell children
doesn't involve increase demands life, less sleep,
demands. certainly case can hire help clean. can hire
nannies thing. can hire help assist babysitting even night
nurses trouble sleeping will literally allow sleep
take care child middle night. Often give excellent care. One hopes
excellent care. won't offset stress associated lack sleep.
million different examples one give this, certainly experienced
graduate school. fact, experience sides equation here. made
little money graduate student. essentially no savings started
graduate school, made little money. amount doesn't matter point,
just barely afford rent food. actually opted live laboratory
lot time. that, money spend things
important me. Now not family time, able that.
Something not everyone can do. made little money, time,
laboratory time, wanted be. level
stress actually pretty low investing time energy
thing knew eventually help bring resources. moved
graduate student postdoc, instance. postdoc generally three
five-year period. sort like residency medicine, no longer taking
courses, continue research. fact, entire new lines research prior
getting professorship. income went slightly, went 30% 40%.
moved times, cost living went way,


way extremely stressed. wasn't absolute income,
absolute income relative cost living. thing one needs consider
considering income versus cost living also notion peer group.
going talk social bonds connections later. one thing
noticed moved graduate student postdoc
graduate student small town access chose participate most,
not all, social gatherings low cost. People tended
aggregate farmer's market Saturday. people wouldn't even purchase
anything, least not graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. just
place aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games soccer just hang
cup coffee. volleyball game Fridays. Sometimes people
go eat evening, course, costs money, et cetera, relatively
low cost living. social connections peer group interactions generated
around fairly low-cost activities. transitioned postdoc, made
money, cost living went up. addition that, peer group tended
want engage kinds activities people larger city
engaged in. peer group tremendously powerful influence whether not
gauge amount money bringing us happiness not.
really speaks critical importance social interactions certain kinds social
interactions, particular. Now, unclear, basically saying
not just able pay rent. also able access kinds
social interactions deem quote-unquote correct stage life
place happen living. can meet
demands costs rent paying power bill food, et cetera,
socially isolated peer group, around want engage
with, engaging activities either don't time for, literally,
things don't financial resources for, can
actually severely impact rating call happiness. parsing
finally? Well, parsing finally think us heard
outcome study Harvard short-term studies, also many
Harvard. talk just phenomenal work Dan Gilbert's
laboratory laboratories focused issues like these. certainly
don't want take anything away results. powerful important
results really point fact people's happiness not


necessarily scale income. fact, tends not past certain level, yet think
remiss, think actually inappropriate say amount

happen making not allow meet basic needs shelter,

00:37:20 Work, Sense Meaning & Happiness

certainly experienced think many probably
experienced well. One major finding Harvard longitudinal study

perhaps no one deathbed says wish worked more, well
indeed, total amount time one spends working not seem determine
one's happiness. yet also want earmark result one need parse
bit carefully. work, last time checked certainly me, way
typically people earn income. just talked moment ago, income
often way people access provide access family things like
recreation opens opportunity social connection, right.
careful interpret blanket statements become
popular money doesn't determine happiness amount work isn't
going determine happiness. certainly case earn money
working money devoted things bring opportunities

care children, care yourself, recreation, things enjoy, well
think little bit naive assume work somehow counter happiness.
Which, course, isn't. especially isn't combine feature work

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote
happiness life people opt not children least happy report
least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether
not people children not. happen find children animals
delightful. always happy people opt children provided
taking good care children best take good care
children. stance. course, entitled stance


this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth
rates, et cetera. Indeed many areas world, birth rates going down. actually
something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling
rate years ago whether not adult diapers elderly
sold rate greater. think one indirect measure
whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting

notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,

things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,

postdoc laboratory first started lab love

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn

also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind

unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant

thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

anyone imagine that. also tends overlook important point,
something certainly learned appreciate life something
especially appreciated student post-doc, following. People
will say money can't buy happiness. talk buy aspect
moment. indeed, true. look longitudinal study look
studies done short-term basis. people get past certain level
income relative cost living, amount happiness not scale
income. is, every additional $1,000 $10,000 earn, don't report
much happier daily basis. Now said, venture argument
money truly cannot buy happiness, absolutely can buffer stress.
particular, can buffer stress form ability purchase pay goods

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote

least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether

this. also general arguments people like whether not

something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least

perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view

ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn

also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning

focused doing, tended report happier mind

wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant

thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

this. also general arguments people like whether not

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health

course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-

notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view

ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music

environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind

unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not

least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things

children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness
certainly overall health. think zero question smoking increases cancers
different kinds. alcohol consumption. particular, alcohol consumption
beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks typical volume beer,

glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories

powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing

environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,

receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends

true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way

really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind

unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused

pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally

described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not

obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness
certainly overall health. think zero question smoking increases cancers
different kinds. alcohol consumption. particular, alcohol consumption
beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks typical volume beer,

glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things

supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles

like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,

things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural

perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view

passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain

So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories

receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize

Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions

gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

00:43:06 Happiness Across Lifespan, Children Make Us Happier?

fact, theme going come today. Nonetheless,
know basis really solid data certain aspects well-
tend change across lifespan. Now lifespan something need
consider also bit nuance humans indeed living longer longer.
look data happiness across lifespan dated maybe 30 40 years
back even 20 years ago, consistently described literature so-called u-
shaped function. people 20s report very, happy, time
goes acquire responsibility. typically, getting married
children mid late 20s 30s 40s. work demands,


et cetera, happiness tends rated lower lower, least previous
studies. happiness tended increase people approach 50s 60s.
tended retire, work demands shed them,
able enjoy small things life despite fact that, general, say almost
always people's health not vigorous 70 20.
exceptions that, course. course, can adjust rate cognitive
physical decline. general, people 20s feel physically mentally
vigorous 60s 70s, general. u-shaped function just
described still holds true today, course, major shifts
general life stages people undergo life stages. instance, many
people getting married much later. Many people opting not children.
fact, look data whether not people children not
relates happiness, everyone will tell kids greatest source joy,
least people will tell tremendous source happiness.
obvious. Kids delightful, raising kids hard wonderful experience.
look ratings happiness among people elected not children versus
had, people children report overall levels happiness
lower people opt not children. Now lot ways
interpret findings. no means encouraging people not children.
issue resolve yourself, course. imagine,
instance, people opt not children income devote things
focused partner aspects life. don't know
underlying reason. perhaps conclude people opt not
children getting sleep regular basis time exercise
sorts things elevate states mood well-being. not
know underlying reasons finding. seem despite
every parent reporting kids greatest source joy quote-unquote
happiness life people opt not children least happy report
least happy even happier opt children. And,
course, want clear not trying settle arguments whether

this. also general arguments people like whether not
population Earth will sustained not sustained based current birth

something just perhaps point interest studied somewhat
unusual logical perspective whether not child diapers selling

sold rate greater. think one indirect measure
whether not people living longer and/or opting children.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness
certainly overall health. think zero question smoking increases cancers
different kinds. alcohol consumption. particular, alcohol consumption
beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks typical volume beer,

00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident



glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number
different things. check episode Dr. Paul Conti like learn

certainly true one year trauma. point need
reframe idea whether not win lottery become paraplegic suffer

Frankly, knew lot teenagers people early 20s pretty unhappy

sometimes less so. highly individual. think general themes
heard over, merit certainly stand
powerful longitudinal short-term studies, nuance, cases,

01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things
can can allow us so-called synthesize happiness. think
one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working
happiness US world, frankly. One great gifts
supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles
way emotional system way reward systems
brain really function. point important concepts going now
discuss. Things like hedonic set point, instance. dopamine system

instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert others explored opportunity choice, is,


freedom can can't lead states happiness. results studies

01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us
degree nonetheless. find mate. Hopefully, mate enjoy spending time

general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,
young adulthood, adulthood. quite understandably come
associate feeling joy happiness receiving things acquisition
things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

postdoc laboratory first started lab love

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,

case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,

earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.

around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing

gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating
reported happiness not. Now one consistent finding absolutely stood
test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit

college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot

rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes

things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number

01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things
can can allow us so-called synthesize happiness. think
one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working
happiness US world, frankly. One great gifts
supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles
way emotional system way reward systems
brain really function. point important concepts going now
discuss. Things like hedonic set point, instance. dopamine system

anything but. actually turns among perhaps potent

instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert others explored opportunity choice, is,


freedom can can't lead states happiness. results studies

01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us
degree nonetheless. find mate. Hopefully, mate enjoy spending time
with. Or, instance, making certain income finding work enjoy regular

focused knowledge things already enjoy. little kid,
like trucks, little kid like dolls, can sort expect
gifts will bring level joy happiness. small child example,
general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,
young adulthood, adulthood. quite understandably come
associate feeling joy happiness receiving things acquisition
things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,

means plant. me, laboratory, one things really critical
postdoc laboratory first started lab love

freshwater tanks discus fish, instance, me, just beautiful. make

talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn

also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.

individuals also focused focused away whatever activity

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant

00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating

test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit
elementary school, high school, et cetera. sort age match, maybe even
college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot
arc time, least life. many people report feeling
rather low birthday use benchmark window
things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able
access. don't think lot three-year-olds sit around comparing
three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start
evaluating peers terms life progression so-called
milestones. argued one reasons people report lower
affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health
effects nicotine discussed episode nicotine. a-- smoking
nicotine, particular, counterproductive people's least self-reported happiness

glass wine cocktail, et cetera, detrimental various aspects health. And,
course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian

music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still

emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories

powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing

know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,

receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come

snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

think, whether not total load responsibility really correlating

test time, kind interesting one. little bit pop psychology finding,
think points something interesting will return
people tend report feeling lower levels happiness, believe not, birthday.
argument following. typically, go year not
comparing peers terribly much. might little bit

college well. evaluation age-match peers not typically
something daily basis. Whereas birthday, get snapshot

things not accomplished. things that, despite age blank,
still haven't accomplished. interesting really points
two things. One extent much feelings happiness relative,
particular, relative peers. social aspect again. fact
time, not good orienting longer arc time.
pretty good knowing arc day, arc week,
arc month, even year, us not good reflecting
life arc. And, course, us don't know long will live


anyway, general sense. mean, people live past age
100. Many people live 70 80. again, life span extending far
know year year. But, general, people report birthdays.
say birthdays aged 25 later, least studies able

three-year-olds well 12-year-olds. can imagine
people might 18, et cetera. really mid-20s people start

affect, lower levels happiness

00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness

birthday. Something little bit counterintuitive. And, course,
things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic
partners people chronic smokers partners people chronic
alcohol users, often will report lower levels happiness. Especially
not chronic smokers regular consumers alcohol. done episodes
nicotine particular, touched smoking, course. done
episode alcohol effects alcohol health. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. study Harvard happiness project really strong data
supporting fact avoiding nicotine smoker. positive health

course, things imagine relate lack happiness.
instance, major trauma. Physical emotional trauma. include loss
major relationship, death close one. victim violent crime
things sort. yet argued, fact, strongly argued look
people's levels happiness trauma, wait year so,
sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things
can can allow us so-called synthesize happiness. think
one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working
happiness US world, frankly. One great gifts
supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles
way emotional system way reward systems

happiness, genuine happiness, simply framing

01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us
degree nonetheless. find mate. Hopefully, mate enjoy spending time
with. Or, instance, making certain income finding work enjoy regular

taught exist. instance, even young, told
birthday coming going get presents, presents going
focused knowledge things already enjoy. little kid,
like trucks, little kid like dolls, can sort expect
gifts will bring level joy happiness. small child example,
general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,
young adulthood, adulthood. quite understandably come
associate feeling joy happiness receiving things acquisition
things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,
particular, features environment can cannot induce states

environmental sound, musical tone, visual feature given space, room,

took form so-called happiness inventories, right. can focusing
things one grateful for, things particularly enjoy. somewhat
gratitude-type practice includes features well focused
things bring meaning actually engaging things bring
meaning. trying think improve levels happiness,
research essentially says smart try adjust home
environment, adjust work environment cheerful you. Maybe
means plant. me, laboratory, one things really critical
postdoc laboratory first started lab love
aquaria. multiple fish tanks. fact, people laboratory always rolling
eyes. fish tanks these-- like freshwater
tanks, not saltwater tanks, reasons aren't interesting discussion.
freshwater tanks discus fish, instance, me, just beautiful. make

music. also use 40 Hertz binaural beats. particularly like listening Glenn


Gould work listening whale song, believe not, work

instance, using music using background sound find pleasant
combined concerted effort part create states happiness hopefully
work meaningful least leading meaningful outcomes.
talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn
interesting important sources creating so-called synthetic happiness.
also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.
realize word synthetic probably draws connotations false happiness

environment on. really determine needed
best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living

additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

things anti-correlated happiness. remiss didn't mention
these. longitudinal study, Harvard happiness project reported,
instance, people chronic smokers nicotine chronic consumers
alcohol, particular alcoholics. is, people suffer alcoholism
sometimes called alcohol use disorder strongly anti-correlated happiness.
also mention family members, particular, romantic

sometimes even short three months trauma, people self-reported
levels happiness not significantly lower prior trauma. Now
much want highlight, underline, bold asterisks statement one
really need explore carefully. data strongly point
fact major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense happiness well-
being. think long going discussion, point
useful definition trauma. definition paraphrase one supplied
former guest Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist
written book called Trauma. personally think best book trauma
tools alleviating trauma. incredibly thorough, easy read, well-informed.
again, paraphrasing, Dr. Conti describes trauma something
fundamentally changes way brain body function way makes
aspects living challenging. Again, event, either emotional physical,
both, fundamentally changes way brain and/or body, nervous
system, organs function way prevents us enjoying daily
activities. even ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination,
can create obsessive thought, can create dissociation. number
different things. check episode Dr. Paul Conti like learn

Frankly, knew lot teenagers people early 20s pretty unhappy

powerful longitudinal short-term studies, nuance, cases,

01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness

now additional data causing us revise understandings. Now
important point, say important point, can really credit
Dan Gilbert others field psychology owe great debt
gratitude far control levels happiness
might think. many things reside level control. is, things
can think say access don't come external things.
don't come necessarily acquisition material goods, rather things
can can allow us so-called synthesize happiness. think
one great gifts modern psychology that-- Dan Gilbert others, Harvard


happiness project, work Yale elsewhere. excellent labs working
happiness US world, frankly. One great gifts
supplied us form data really things can
think access allow so-called synthesize happiness. Now,
notion synthesizing happiness, synthetic happiness sometimes called, can
sometimes ruffle people's feathers bit. people immediately flip idea
that, oh, just going tell grateful just navel gaze
just imagine happy. really not synthetic happiness
all. Synthetic happiness actually really important larger principles
way emotional system way reward systems
brain really function. point important concepts going now
discuss. Things like hedonic set point, instance. dopamine system
anticipation rewards versus receiving words just brief insight that.
anticipation something positive oftentimes leads greater increases sorts
neurochemicals support state happiness well-being actual
acquisition thing trying obtain. goes back theme
discussed times podcast, particular colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, wrote fabulous book Dopamine Nation.
interested dopamine addiction, particular, wonderful clear,
extremely informative read. interested dopamine generally, not just
states addiction everyday life pursuit motivation, Molecule
excellent book related that. mentioned earlier,
episode dopamine motivation drive. notion synthetic happiness not
simply imagining happiness, thinking happiness anticipating
happiness. extent, is, relates number important themes.
grounded thoroughly neurobiology dopamine rewards. talk
neurobiology moments. want take couple
minutes talk synthetic happiness conditions
allowing us access state so-called synthetic happiness. want point
outset synthetic happiness, might sound synthetic A.K.A. false,
anything but. actually turns among perhaps potent
form happiness can access. themes related control
internal state really become not valid powerful. So,
instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert others explored opportunity choice, is,


freedom can can't lead states happiness. results studies
solid and, frankly, surprising. understand results,
do, think will immediately see areas life can start access
happiness, genuine happiness, simply framing

01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music

certain choices particular way maybe even eliminating choices. Now like
focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us
degree nonetheless. find mate. Hopefully, mate enjoy spending time
with. Or, instance, making certain income finding work enjoy regular
basis. forms happiness that, early time development,
taught exist. instance, even young, told
birthday coming going get presents, presents going
focused knowledge things already enjoy. little kid,
like trucks, little kid like dolls, can sort expect
gifts will bring level joy happiness. small child example,
general notion natural happiness is, course, one persists adolescence,
young adulthood, adulthood. quite understandably come
associate feeling joy happiness receiving things acquisition
things, whether effort, gift, inheritance, form. natural
happiness. yet, mentioned little bit earlier, also notion synthetic
happiness. interesting exciting research fields
psychology and, fact, neuroscience point idea synthetic happiness least
powerful source happiness natural happiness. Again, least powerful
perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view
happiness order accept idea can create happiness
ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,
particular, features environment can cannot induce states
happiness. basic takeaway studies certain
environmental sound, musical tone, visual feature given space, room,
necessary state happiness, not alone sufficient. required
individuals not placed environment contains music visual items
combination music visual items can induce states joy happiness


positive anticipation, also given sort instruction instruction
manual synthesize happiness inside environment. important
says ability create states happiness dependent
environment also requires effort us. also makes sense

earlier. case, number people profoundly negatively

people, call dynamic relationship environment.
environment effect mood. research indicates also
need make sort effort toward happy. Now effort toward happy
vague term. better define is. case Dr. Mandich's work,
took form so-called happiness inventories, right. can focusing
things one grateful for, things particularly enjoy. somewhat
gratitude-type practice includes features well focused
things bring meaning actually engaging things bring
meaning. trying think improve levels happiness,
research essentially says smart try adjust home
environment, adjust work environment cheerful you. Maybe
means plant. me, laboratory, one things really critical
postdoc laboratory first started lab love
aquaria. multiple fish tanks. fact, people laboratory always rolling
eyes. fish tanks these-- like freshwater
tanks, not saltwater tanks, reasons aren't interesting discussion.
freshwater tanks discus fish, instance, me, just beautiful. make
happy. just enjoy them. Music complicated thing laboratories
shared space. headphones general requirement. either silence
love silence. happen like working silence listening certain forms
music. also use 40 Hertz binaural beats. particularly like listening Glenn


Gould work listening whale song, believe not, work
doesn't structure can follow. don't speak whale, can't follow.
sort fills space way find pleasant. put substantial amounts
effort making laboratory spaces office spaces, workspaces, nice
places be. Now no knowledge work Dr. Mandich others
time that. found years, challenged
maintaining kind elevated mood working laboratory, not didn't
thoroughly enjoy work, love experiments hands, loved
lab, least labs graduate student post-doc no

wasn't getting lot fresh air, forth. personally found
valuable create environment work home find aesthetically
pleasant, least way another. realize people varying levels
control aesthetic environment. Certainly, auditory environment can
controlled nowadays use headphones allowed use those. So,
instance, using music using background sound find pleasant
combined concerted effort part create states happiness hopefully
work meaningful least leading meaningful outcomes.
talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn
interesting important sources creating so-called synthetic happiness.
also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.
realize word synthetic probably draws connotations false happiness
contrived happiness. wish instead calling synthetic happiness. called
self-created self-directed happiness something sort wouldn't
sound false. simply not false. leads same, far know,
identical neurochemical psychological states happiness natural happiness.
might even persistent natural happiness. certainly,
control. key point environment self-directed work happy
important, interact one another. somebody
hard time synthesizing happiness methods talk today,
don't consider deficient. well environment in,
social environment physical environment, auditory environment, simply not
conducive synthesizing happiness. reason, think work Gillian
Mandich colleagues others field tremendously important


removes us pressure just synthesize happiness within despite
circumstances. think many us heard incredible stories people like
Viktor Frankl Nelson Mandela stripped freedom yet managed
maintain sense positive anticipation least sense identity
allowed still access forms happiness. highly unique situations,
course. speak power human psyche synthesizing happiness
certainly synthesizing sense might future live
future. cases, incredibly impressive ways. think everybody,
environment powerful impact mood. people
others. know people perfectly happy blank walls. No pictures
walls. people benefit tremendously photos plants
environment on. really determine needed
best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care
can assist neighbor physically less able retrieve paper, et cetera, et
cetera. point giving resources, certainly form money, also
form effort time, immensely beneficial synthesizing happiness.

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now
whole notion staying present one little bit complicated.

gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

additional questions asked them, able establish whether

individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian

particularly interesting one explored different types music

one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories

receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain

environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come

snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking

expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,

gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found

prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner

really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus

important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave

say extent can, means whatever percentage

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness

money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant

like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us

perhaps even powerful. course, one take slightly different view

ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit

paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,

discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

social connection studied review both, relates increasing

focus research aimed understanding increases levels happiness.
like frame umbrella two major themes. first theme so-
called natural happiness. Natural happiness sort happiness us
familiar with. kind happiness expect we, instance,
complete degree. Hopefully, degree topic meaningful interesting us

ourselves, doesn't mean whole notion synthetic happiness merely
passive one sit back imagine happy
happy. better worse, nervous systems neurochemistry simply don't


work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work

involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen

emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused

know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building

best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

work way. fact, synthetic happiness almost always understood
something put effort toward achieving. But,
important thing point out, synthetic happiness also requires certain situational
environmental conditions met. good example work Gillian
Mandich, say Dr. Gillian Mandich, done interesting work
conditions creating happiness within mind overall state being.
involved number different studies. one ones found
particularly interesting one explored different types music
aspects environmental settings. bring subjects laboratory play
different types music. are, fact, certain aspects music can create
different states mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. fact, certain
patterns music can reliably induce anticipation fear anxiety base type.
So, instance, think movie Jaws. recall, seen
Jaws, ongoing theme music time shark might present water
given scene. essentially goes [HUMMING] Now musicians there,
basis things like tritones things understood mathematics
musical side. neuroscience side, known create neural
state anticipation. Yeah, neural state anticipation not necessarily positive
one. indeed, patterns music involve tones. Think
music typically used cartoons various sorts. long history
this. Indeed whole literature psychological now even smaller still
interesting literature neuroscience certain patterns music can induce
state joy joyful anticipation, particular. lot patterns music
incorporated so-called happy cartoons Disney movies

01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude

things sort. case, Dr. Mandich others explored music,
particular, features environment can cannot induce states

need make sort effort toward happy. Now effort toward happy
vague term. better define is. case Dr. Mandich's work,
took form so-called happiness inventories, right. can focusing
things one grateful for, things particularly enjoy. somewhat
gratitude-type practice includes features well focused
things bring meaning actually engaging things bring
meaning. trying think improve levels happiness,
research essentially says smart try adjust home
environment, adjust work environment cheerful you. Maybe
means plant. me, laboratory, one things really critical
postdoc laboratory first started lab love
aquaria. multiple fish tanks. fact, people laboratory always rolling
eyes. fish tanks these-- like freshwater
tanks, not saltwater tanks, reasons aren't interesting discussion.
freshwater tanks discus fish, instance, me, just beautiful. make
happy. just enjoy them. Music complicated thing laboratories
shared space. headphones general requirement. either silence

control aesthetic environment. Certainly, auditory environment can
controlled nowadays use headphones allowed use those. So,
instance, using music using background sound find pleasant
combined concerted effort part create states happiness hopefully
work meaningful least leading meaningful outcomes.
talk little bit that. happiness inventories also turn
interesting important sources creating so-called synthetic happiness.
also talk ways one can create elevated levels synthetic happiness.
realize word synthetic probably draws connotations false happiness
contrived happiness. wish instead calling synthetic happiness. called
self-created self-directed happiness something sort wouldn't

Mandich colleagues others field tremendously important


removes us pressure just synthesize happiness within despite

certainly synthesizing sense might future live

environment powerful impact mood. people
others. know people perfectly happy blank walls. No pictures
walls. people benefit tremendously photos plants
environment on. really determine needed
best try place things environment, rather, place
environment conducive synthesizing happiness. fact, powerful
interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist
vacuum. not independent surroundings. So, instance, just writing
things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.
person receiving understands something person giving
understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care
can assist neighbor physically less able retrieve paper, et cetera, et
cetera. point giving resources, certainly form money, also
form effort time, immensely beneficial synthesizing happiness.
giver, us, increase levels happiness. degree increase

actually needed help

01:31:55 Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now
whole notion staying present one little bit complicated.

allogrooming. talking number different things one can

talking performance resources relates natural happiness, not
synthetic happiness, natural happiness. wrong, believe,
say income doesn't matter. think fair say, based research,


income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes
buffer. mean buffer? mean buffer anxiety circumstances
might change important. Now going vary person person. Meaning
people will perfectly happy making $1 absolute cost living
every month. people will require substantial buffer order protect

interaction environment ability generate certain kinds
emotions well established not just happiness things like gratitude. So,
instance, classic study AMES A-M-E-S 2004 focused
gratitude. episode gratitude before. basic takeaway
episode turns receiving gratitude powerful stimulus release
neurochemicals activation brain areas associated so-called prosocial
behaviors feelings well-being, including happiness. also observing stories
form movies books narratives people receiving help also
powerful stimulus gratitude. Also, giving gratitude powerful not
powerful receiving gratitude, least research says, observing
powerful exchanges gratitude individuals. study AMES
showed gratitude state mind emotion not exist

things grateful positive impact, impact
receiving gratitude observing gratitude far potent, right. Bigger increases
happiness feelings well-being indeed neurochemicals activation brain
areas associated happiness well-being reciprocity.

understands person giving genuinely, instance.
environmental interaction. not just receiving, receiving somebody


know genuinely wants give. likewise, giver equation,
feelings well-being far greater person receiving whatever money,
food, assistance form another. physical assistance, et cetera.
giver knowledge person receiving genuinely needed thing
receiving. important finding within research, again,
happiness doesn't exist vacuum. partially responsibility synthesize
happiness. know, told many times like happiness head.
Well, yes, indeed, head, also dependent interactions
environment. Physical environment social environment, on. Likewise,
gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists
appreciation, can give powerful sources evoking neurochemical changes
associated gratitude happiness well-being. it, too, doesn't exist
vacuum. much greater positive effect knowledge
giver giving us something person receiving something going benefit
tremendously receiving it. highlighting think
hear synthetic happiness, kind automatic erasing context tends
occur. fact, peruse various videos online papers exist
PubMed around happiness synthetic happiness, particular, come
away impression synthetic happiness just something supposed
snap fingers access perhaps specific things access.
true, context really matters. think important point. Much
way point needs made money doesn't buy happiness, money
can buffer stress certainly offer opportunities can provide opportunities
happiness.

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care
can assist neighbor physically less able retrieve paper, et cetera, et
cetera. point giving resources, certainly form money, also
form effort time, immensely beneficial synthesizing happiness.

01:31:55 Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now
whole notion staying present one little bit complicated.
episode meditation talked little bit whether not beneficial present

full empty gut feels state skin inward, whether
not focus present things immediate surroundings.

01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact

feel right now. said, think us can appreciate immense value
social connection long lasting, lack better word, richer
type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic
partners. reason, want emphasize little bit constitutes
connection constitutes social connection. basically two forms
social connection studied review both, relates increasing
levels happiness. first one presence eye contact, second
physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies
whether not people exchange direct eye contact conversation not,
dictating whether not individual interaction feels
connection. Now again, keep mind think connection relating


deep meaningful conversation, oftentimes can case. Think
instance, excellent therapist patient relationship. excellent romantic
relationship. excellent friendship really feel heard understood,
least extent people willing explore certain topics you. willing
hear listen really carefully saying, willing hear
listen saying attempt understand. certainly can enhance
sense social connection leading people call social bonds leading
increased happiness. eye contact also known important feature.
thing eye contact people assume lot eye contact, fact,

flesh little bit data, eye contact, say mutual eye contact,

forth. basic takeaway study following.
quoting study. Quote "Rather maximizing shared attention, good
conversation may require shifts shared states accompanied eye
contact". basically says two people involved very,


call intimate conversation, word intimate not misconstrued
mean something intimacy sexual intimacy physical intimacy. Just
conversation people feel present conversation focused
conversation conversation contents only. tendency people
take turns talking, although sometimes, depending individuals might interrupt
less. Again, interrupting can sign interest, doesn't always
rude, way. sharing information. Hopefully, common topic
set topics. will moment look one another. study
shows. briefly gazing directly one another, attention peaks,
will look away, attention will get reduced. conversation consists
series focusing back one another eyes, focusing off, focusing
focusing off. mutual eye contact moments actually predict
breaking attention. ramping attention braking attention.
Ramping attention braking attention. think important results
violate stereotype assumption deep social connection
sort leading happiness always involves ongoing eye contact ongoing focus. Just
meditation, just activity, frankly, undergo shifts attention
focus. focus ramps breaks, re-engages. ramps
breaks, re-engages. that, turns out, basis in-depth connected
conversation. interested creating social connection
context, particular sake increasing happiness, clear
social connections, even fairly superficial social connections, can increase
sense happiness. Seeing faces important. Ideally, faces person, although
suppose days, Zoom screen type medium close
second. point want increase happiness need quality
social connections. want quality social connections need

faces important social connection relates synthetic happiness.
know eye contact really important building social connection. Physical
contact also important social connection. not just romantic sexual type
connection. fact, form physical connection present
primates. fact, present far know, mammals. also much
feature human nervous system. something called allogrooming.
imagine people probably haven't heard allogrooming. reason
bringing alogrooming stems fairly extensive literature
prosocial, pro happiness effects pets humans. fact, want read
this, paper Yale University topic published 2018.
title paper "The influence interactions dogs affect", OK emotion,
"anxety arousal children". references studies
performed humans. basic takeaway so-called AAAs, animal
assisted activities, represent really potent way increase people, including children's
feelings well-being. Now interesting dogs
don't really much except present room order positive
effects, is, reductions anxiety, increases happiness, et cetera, occur.
fact, can very, brief. describe paper, "brief unstructured
interactions unfamiliar dog", don't even need know dog, "after


exposure moderate stressor showed higher positive affect relevant participants
received soothing object waited amount time." just even
seeing dog brief amount time shown reduce stress improve
happiness, say, increase feelings happiness overall child receiving
soothing object. was, least me, little bit counterintuitive.
thought children receiving soothing object powerful
stimulus. fact, wasn't, least not study. real question think
asking is, interactions others
animals potentially prosocial happiness enhancing effect?
reason raise also think many people interested either owning

02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness

allogrooming. talking number different things one can
order increase levels happiness. certainly, conclude today,
going touch back not just synthetic happiness various things can do,
prosocial spending, allogrooming, social connection, et cetera. also things
related happiness involve focus vocation work pursuit goals.
mentioned beginning, also critical increasing state
happiness, certainly state security feeling can provide
perhaps others, well. will talk that. think also
important talk notion choice choices, whether not lot
freedom choose limited freedom choosing get,
able pursue life, relates natural happiness
synthetic happiness. Dan Gilbert others explored issue freedom
choice relates happiness. must say, findings incredibly


counterintuitive. very, well supported data. going summarize
large amount studies saying following. Dan's laboratory
laboratories done experiments give people series options.
one classic examples, give people opportunity rate number

one later time. words, experiments really weren't
rating pictures, really whether not constraining choice, meaning
forcing somebody make choice stick choice, led greater levels
lesser levels happiness satisfaction choice. find
consistently people ongoing set choices leads reduced
levels happiness. Now might come surprising many you, want
clear means. not say lot choices
like leads lesser happiness. fewer choices things do,
objects acquire, et cetera, leads greater happiness. set
experiments really points make choice, forced stick
choice tend far happier choice maintain option
change mind. results experiments extremely informative, believe,
terms understanding real life happiness. is, happiness outside
laboratory. think often misunderstood meaning lot
choices tend less happy fewer choices. not case.
freedom choice terrific. actually, correlates elevated levels
happiness. make choice, clearly case killing
choices options killed us increases satisfaction choice
made. Whereas, leaving doors open, leaving options open greatly diminishes
sense satisfaction. exported number different domains.

Hence, treatments aimed alleviating depression mania target

access referring performance resources.
talking performance resources relates natural happiness, not
synthetic happiness, natural happiness. wrong, believe,
say income doesn't matter. think fair say, based research,


income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes
buffer. mean buffer? mean buffer anxiety circumstances
might change important. Now going vary person person. Meaning
people will perfectly happy making $1 absolute cost living
every month. people will require substantial buffer order protect
negative psychological effects worrying instance, inflation.
worrying might lose job. think people recommend
having, possible, buffer bank account cover two three
maybe even six maybe even 12 months living expenses lose job
something catastrophic happened them. going talk happiness,
think fair, accurate, frankly, respectful talk living
requirements cost living requirements. includes sort buffer.
buffer anxiety going vary depending anxious somebody gets
possibility catastrophic things happening them, like losing job rent
going doubling. here, talking hypotheticals. think know
people perhaps experienced kinds circumstances.
talk happiness absolutely need think resources. also need
think performance. think completely inaccurate simply said,
oh, work leading outcomes. effort, regardless whether not gets
school F school isn't going impact happiness. don't think
anyone agree that. yet look major takeaways, least
communicated typically public sphere around longitudinal short

money not important. don't think anyone saying actually means
income can cover expenses plus buffer isn't important. often

gratitude something can create inside us right gratitude lists

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage

right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now

social connection long lasting, lack better word, richer
type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic

social connection studied review both, relates increasing

physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.

different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness

studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage

tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind

2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home

outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact

feel right now. said, think us can appreciate immense value
social connection long lasting, lack better word, richer
type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic
partners. reason, want emphasize little bit constitutes
connection constitutes social connection. basically two forms
social connection studied review both, relates increasing
levels happiness. first one presence eye contact, second
physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies
whether not people exchange direct eye contact conversation not,
dictating whether not individual interaction feels
connection. Now again, keep mind think connection relating


deep meaningful conversation, oftentimes can case. Think
instance, excellent therapist patient relationship. excellent romantic
relationship. excellent friendship really feel heard understood,
least extent people willing explore certain topics you. willing
hear listen really carefully saying, willing hear
listen saying attempt understand. certainly can enhance
sense social connection leading people call social bonds leading
increased happiness. eye contact also known important feature.
thing eye contact people assume lot eye contact, fact,
ongoing eye contact, critical sense connection. fact, not case.
recent paper find really interesting published Proceedings

Ramping attention braking attention. think important results

01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness

think starting arrive general theme here, nothing related
mood exists isolation. fact, leads discussion one
major scientific findings realm sorts mindsets behaviors can, fact,
lead happiness. paper published 2008. Even though
might seem like ago, forms basis large amount literature
followed. interesting literature. work Elizabeth Dunn
colleagues published Journal Science. Which, again, one sort


three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, always say sort Super Bowl, NBA
championships, Stanley Cup scientific publishing-- very, stringent terms
number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking
certain portion income, giving others. Often causes
things think important see happen world change world.
hungry individual access food medical care.
environmental causes. animal wellness. number
different things. even giving somebody money can buy
gift giving somebody money not understanding
expectation going money. Again, one central themes
around gratitude receiving great, giving also great terms increasing


sense well-being. one important features give,
either form words form resources, knowledge person
receiving benefits real way, greatly increases chance
increase happiness giver, well receiver. Again, note
gratitude, not insignificant one relates study. study found
higher prosocial spending associated significantly greater happiness.
statistically significant effect. found effects income
prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent
similar magnitude. explain means might confused
statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained
unrelated happiness". study basically found people allotted
certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees
devoted bonuses prosocial spending, giving way
money, experience greater happiness receiving bonus, manner
spent bonus important predictor happiness
size bonus itself". actual experiment ran real income, real
money. going read just make sure hits home, found
really impactful. "Employees devoted greater fraction bonus
prosocial spending, giving away money others, experienced greater happiness
receiving bonus. manner spent bonus
important predictor happiness size bonus itself." actual
bonus, receiving money, led greater increases happiness gave
away. act giving away itself, led greater increases happiness
receiving bonus. twofer, might say. takeaway study
studies like it, think pretty obvious extent can. again,
say extent can, means whatever percentage
income can afford give away, don't income, percentage
effort. mean money, also effort. can help others,
right? can serve food kitchens, can community gardening, can pick


trash, can number things. can assist neighbor child care

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now
whole notion staying present one little bit complicated.
episode meditation talked little bit whether not beneficial present

full empty gut feels state skin inward, whether
not focus present things immediate surroundings.

number papers let in. few, is. title paper makes fairly
obvious paper about. title paper "spending money others
promotes happiness". know number probably hear title think, oh
boy, go. going tell us giving away money going make us
happier receiving money. promise you, not going tell you.
nonetheless, interesting study, one think really
pay attention to. study based fact income,
provided one's income meets certain level basic needs, indeed shown
weak effect overall happiness. OK? quoting paper first
paragraph, quote "income reliable surprisingly weak effect happiness within
nations". Within nations just mean looked not just United States,
number places, well. "Particularly basic needs met." OK,
case, aspects money money related happiness?
Certainly, people lot money happy. Certainly,
people little money happy. course, reverse
also true. plenty people don't much money
unhappy, fact, people lot money unhappy.
point whenever made often leads less money kind roll
eyes, assumption money increase happiness. fact,
doesn't. later, get back idea whether one acquired money
impact whether not money increases happiness not. kind
earmark later. meantime, talk little bit findings
paper. paper interesting, explored something called
prosocial spending. Prosocial spending phenomenon people taking

prosocial spending independent similar magnitude. Independent

statement just moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained

certain amount money give away, one adjusts overall income,
important, imagine individual giving away $2,000 might
represent significant portion yearly monthly income. another
individual might represent tiny fraction income. adjust
income level, find people gave away money benefited
tremendously terms increase happiness. fact, quote, "employees

registers help. Excellent research also points fact another potent way
synthesize happiness, create genuine states happiness ourselves,
leverage so-called focus system. rather, say de-emphasize
tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.
sort obvious. really speaks tremendous power building
ability focus doing. stay present doing. Now
whole notion staying present one little bit complicated.

not focus present things immediate surroundings.

tendency minds wander. excellent paper this, also published
Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.
able contact subjects going living
daily lives ask feeling.
additional questions asked them, able establish whether
not people watching television housework working home
computer resting listening music, et cetera, natural environment.
outside laboratory. able assess extent people
happy unhappy neutral, emotional state time
engaging number different activities. assessed whether not
individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

social connection studied review both, relates increasing

increased happiness. eye contact also known important feature.
thing eye contact people assume lot eye contact, fact,

Journal Science. now classic paper. talked little bit
episode meditation, perhaps didn't hear episode,
just want briefly touch aspects paper. particular, aspects
paper didn't talk previously. title paper, again,
straightforward terms telling about. is, "A wandering mind
unhappy mind" Killingsworth Gilbert. paper published Science
2010, will provide link paper. frankly, interesting paper.
paper involved several subjects, say, 2,250 adult subjects.

individuals also focused focused away whatever activity
engaging in. takeaways study many, sake today's
discussion, think especially interesting regardless whether not
people engaging activities enjoyed not, tendency mind


wander activity predicted lower levels happiness tended
focused activity engaged in. Now surprising.
mean, says even somebody engaged activity like cleaning
house homework reading something weren't enjoying,
focused doing, tended report happier mind
drifting elsewhere. Now also points idea perhaps minds drift
unpleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts. also addressed
study. Point like make quote "although people's minds likely
wander pleasant topics unpleasant topics" difference pretty
significant. People's minds tended wander pleasant topics 43% time
opposed unpleasant topics 27% time. neutral topics
remaining 31% samples. "People no happier thinking pleasant
topics current activity". Think that. "People no happier
thinking pleasant things current activity". fact, mere focus
powerful anything else, even didn't enjoy
doing. go say, quote "although negative moods
known cause mind wandering, now see strongly suggested mind wandering
generally cause, cause, not merely consequence unhappiness."
lot aspects study worth going into. major takeaway,
one perhaps concerned with, not
focused doing, tend far less happy focused
doing. Even something don't deem
pleasant. certainly, engaged something consider pleasant
focused on, well levels happiness highest.

type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic

social connection studied review both, relates increasing

physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies
whether not people exchange direct eye contact conversation not,
dictating whether not individual interaction feels

deep meaningful conversation, oftentimes can case. Think
instance, excellent therapist patient relationship. excellent romantic

imagine people probably haven't heard allogrooming. reason
bringing alogrooming stems fairly extensive literature
prosocial, pro happiness effects pets humans. fact, want read
this, paper Yale University topic published 2018.
title paper "The influence interactions dogs affect", OK emotion,

seeing dog brief amount time shown reduce stress improve

01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact

feel right now. said, think us can appreciate immense value
social connection long lasting, lack better word, richer
type, whether not siblings parents friends romantic
partners. reason, want emphasize little bit constitutes
connection constitutes social connection. basically two forms
social connection studied review both, relates increasing

physical contact. terms presence eye contact lot studies
whether not people exchange direct eye contact conversation not,
dictating whether not individual interaction feels
connection. Now again, keep mind think connection relating


deep meaningful conversation, oftentimes can case. Think
instance, excellent therapist patient relationship. excellent romantic

call intimate conversation, word intimate not misconstrued
mean something intimacy sexual intimacy physical intimacy. Just
conversation people feel present conversation focused

will look away, attention will get reduced. conversation consists
series focusing back one another eyes, focusing off, focusing
focusing off. mutual eye contact moments actually predict
breaking attention. ramping attention braking attention.
Ramping attention braking attention. think important results
violate stereotype assumption deep social connection

seeing dog brief amount time shown reduce stress improve

imagine people probably haven't heard allogrooming. reason
bringing alogrooming stems fairly extensive literature

02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness

allogrooming. talking number different things one can
order increase levels happiness. certainly, conclude today,
going touch back not just synthetic happiness various things can do,
prosocial spending, allogrooming, social connection, et cetera. also things
related happiness involve focus vocation work pursuit goals.
mentioned beginning, also critical increasing state
happiness, certainly state security feeling can provide
perhaps others, well. will talk that. think also
important talk notion choice choices, whether not lot
freedom choose limited freedom choosing get,
able pursue life, relates natural happiness
synthetic happiness. Dan Gilbert others explored issue freedom
choice relates happiness. must say, findings incredibly


counterintuitive. very, well supported data. going summarize
large amount studies saying following. Dan's laboratory
laboratories done experiments give people series options.
one classic examples, give people opportunity rate number
different paintings pictures ascending descending order preference.
words, deciding ones like ones like least.
interesting experimenter will vary extent stick
choice. sticking choice receiving painting take

photograph they, research subject took, another photograph took.
One photographs going go off publication, another one
keep themselves. conditions experiment either
make decision final, is, keep one rate decision,
keep one opportunity swap picture
one later time. words, experiments really weren't
rating pictures, really whether not constraining choice, meaning
forcing somebody make choice stick choice, led greater levels
lesser levels happiness satisfaction choice. find
consistently people ongoing set choices leads reduced
levels happiness. Now might come surprising many you, want
clear means. not say lot choices
like leads lesser happiness. fewer choices things do,
objects acquire, et cetera, leads greater happiness. set
experiments really points make choice, forced stick
choice tend far happier choice maintain option
change mind. results experiments extremely informative, believe,
terms understanding real life happiness. is, happiness outside

choices tend less happy fewer choices. not case.
freedom choice terrific. actually, correlates elevated levels

choices options killed us increases satisfaction choice
made. Whereas, leaving doors open, leaving options open greatly diminishes
sense satisfaction. exported number different domains.

talking performance resources relates natural happiness, not
synthetic happiness, natural happiness. wrong, believe,

income matters. income can cover costs living plus includes

people will perfectly happy making $1 absolute cost living
