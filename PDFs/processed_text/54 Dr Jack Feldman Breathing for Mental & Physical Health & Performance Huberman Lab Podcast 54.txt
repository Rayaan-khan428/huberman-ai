access Breath Collective. now conversation Dr. Jack
Feldman. Thanks joining today. - pleasure here, Andrew. - Yeah,
long time coming. go-to source things respiration. mean,
breathe own, want understand breathe brain
breathing interact, person call. - Well, best. know,
lot don't understand, still keeps employed engaged,
know lot. - don't start off just talking involved generating


breath. would, comment mechanisms rhythmic
breathing versus non rhythmic breathing? - Okay, mechanical side,
obvious everyone, want air flow in, inhale, need air flow
reason need body metabolism, need oxygen.
oxygen utilized aerobic metabolic process, produce carbon
dioxide. so, get rid carbon dioxide produce particular
carbon dioxide affects acid base balance blood, pH,
living cells sensitive pH value is, body interested
regulating pH. enough oxygen normal metabolism,
get rid CO2 produce. So, generate air flow?
Well, air comes lungs. expand lungs lungs
expand, basically, like balloon pull apart. pressure inside
balloon drops air will flow balloon. expand, put pressure
lungs pull apart, lowers pressure air sacks called alveoli air will
flow pressure outside body higher pressure inside body
expansion, inhaling. produces that? Well,
principle muscle diaphragm, sitting inside body just lung,
want inhale, basically contract diaphragm pulls down.
pulls down, inserting pressure forces lung, lung wants
expand. time, rib cage going rotate out, therefore
expanding cavity, thoracic cavity. end inspiration, normal
conditions aggressed, just relax like pulling spring.
pull spring let go relax. So, inhale exhale. Inhale, relax,
exhale. - So, exhale passive? - rest passive. get
happens need increase amount air bringing
ventilation, metabolism goes like exercise. Now muscles themselves,
skeletal muscles don't anything unless nervous system tells
something. nervous system tells something, contract. So,
specialized neurons spinal cord, spinal cord,
region called brainstem, go respiratory muscles, particular inspiration
diaphragm external intercostal muscles rib cage. contract.
So, respiratory muscles inspiratory muscles become active

effort. neurons pre-Botzinger complex finish burst activity,
inspiration stops begin

00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing

exhale passive recoil lung rib cage. - just briefly
interrupt ask quick questions - course. - move forward
informative answer. two questions are, anything known
activation diaphragm intercostal muscles ribs relates
nose versus mouth breathing, activated equivalent way, regardless
whether not someone breathing nose mouth? - don't think fully
answer that. Clearly differences nasal mouth
breathing. rest tendency nasal breathing air flows
necessary normal breathing easily managed passing nasal
cavities. However, ventilation needs increase like exercise,
need move air, mouth airways much


larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,

better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,

Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw

Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing

so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells

cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -

crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether

system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

respiration humans little bit, brain imaging. can't help ask
somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations

magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,

basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one

transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots

00:10:35 Breathe

access Breath Collective. now conversation Dr. Jack
Feldman. Thanks joining today. - pleasure here, Andrew. - Yeah,
long time coming. go-to source things respiration. mean,
breathe own, want understand breathe brain
breathing interact, person call. - Well, best. know,
lot don't understand, still keeps employed engaged,
know lot. - don't start off just talking involved generating


breath. would, comment mechanisms rhythmic
breathing versus non rhythmic breathing? - Okay, mechanical side,
obvious everyone, want air flow in, inhale, need air flow
reason need body metabolism, need oxygen.
oxygen utilized aerobic metabolic process, produce carbon
dioxide. so, get rid carbon dioxide produce particular
carbon dioxide affects acid base balance blood, pH,
living cells sensitive pH value is, body interested
regulating pH. enough oxygen normal metabolism,
get rid CO2 produce. So, generate air flow?
Well, air comes lungs. expand lungs lungs
expand, basically, like balloon pull apart. pressure inside
balloon drops air will flow balloon. expand, put pressure
lungs pull apart, lowers pressure air sacks called alveoli air will
flow pressure outside body higher pressure inside body
expansion, inhaling. produces that? Well,
principle muscle diaphragm, sitting inside body just lung,
want inhale, basically contract diaphragm pulls down.
pulls down, inserting pressure forces lung, lung wants
expand. time, rib cage going rotate out, therefore
expanding cavity, thoracic cavity. end inspiration, normal
conditions aggressed, just relax like pulling spring.
pull spring let go relax. So, inhale exhale. Inhale, relax,
exhale. - So, exhale passive? - rest passive. get
happens need increase amount air bringing
ventilation, metabolism goes like exercise. Now muscles themselves,
skeletal muscles don't anything unless nervous system tells
something. nervous system tells something, contract. So,
specialized neurons spinal cord, spinal cord,
region called brainstem, go respiratory muscles, particular inspiration
diaphragm external intercostal muscles rib cage. contract.
So, respiratory muscles inspiratory muscles become active
become active period time,



00:14:35 Neural Control Breathing: “Pre-Botzinger Complex”

become silent become silent, muscles relax back
original resting level. activity neurons innovate
muscle, called motor neurons, originate? Well,
question bandied around thousands years,
beginning assistant professor, fairly high priority try figure out,
wanted understand rhythm breathing coming
couldn't know coming knew coming from.
didn't phrase properly. couldn't understand done
know look. So, lot experiments, can go detail
finally found, region brainstem, region sort
spinal cord, critical generating rhythm. called pre-
Botzinger complex. can talk named. small site,
contains humans, thousand neurons, located either side works
tandem every breath begins neurons region beginning active,
neurons connect ultimately motor neurons going diaphragm
external intercostals causing active causing inspiratory
effort. neurons pre-Botzinger complex finish burst activity,
inspiration stops begin

00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing

exhale passive recoil lung rib cage. - just briefly
interrupt ask quick questions - course. - move forward
informative answer. two questions are, anything known
activation diaphragm intercostal muscles ribs relates
nose versus mouth breathing, activated equivalent way, regardless
whether not someone breathing nose mouth? - don't think fully
answer that. Clearly differences nasal mouth
breathing. rest tendency nasal breathing air flows
necessary normal breathing easily managed passing nasal
cavities. However, ventilation needs increase like exercise,
need move air, mouth airways much


larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got
next door colleague. - Right. - Yeah. - said, "Why asking this?"
said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio
victims iron lungs principal deficit no hyperinflation
lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people
will overdose drugs various kinds stopped breathing. So,
barbiturates, alcohol combined barbiturates common cause death drug
users contra-indications drugs, kinds things. hear time
celebrities dying combined alcohol barbiturates.
evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine
sighs don't happen consequence drug impacting brain centers,
one cause basically asphyxiation death. - look


progression mammal death, find breathing slows down, death
due natural causes, breathing slows down, will stop, gasp. So,
phrase dying gasp [inhales]. Super large breaths. often described
attempt auto resuscitate, take super deep breath
maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able
re-arouse breathing, prevented, don't get re-aroused. So,
certainly possibility, not investigated. mean, one things
interested individuals diseases, will affect pre-Botzinger
complex. data Parkinson's disease multiple system atrophy,
another form neurodegeneration loss neurons pre-Botzinger.
question is, also may happen ALS, sometimes referred Lou Gehrig's
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. individuals often die sleep.
idea not able get anyone test patients
Parkinson's, patients MLS typically breathe normally wakefulness.
disturbances breathing sleep. So, Parkinson's patients
end stages disease often significant disturbances sleep pattern,
not wakefulness. think happening proximate
cause death not heart failure, become apneic. stop breathing
don't resuscitate. resuscitation may may not due explicit
suppression sighs, overall suppression whole apparatus pre-
Botzinger complex. - Got it. Thank you. So, Yackle calls up. - So, calls
he's, great kid, super smart, tells experiments
looking database try find molecules enriched
regions brain critical breathing. So, others mapped
regions brainstem, looking one databases see
enriched. said, "That's great. Will willing sort share work
together?" says, "No, advisor doesn't want that." said, "Okay,"
Kevin's great kid, enjoy talking smart guy, found
academia smartest people want hire people smarter
preference interact people smarter them. faculty not
highest level every institution, distribution. One's mean,
mean, mean threatened that.


saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just

like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became

asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

00:10:35 Breathe

access Breath Collective. now conversation Dr. Jack
Feldman. Thanks joining today. - pleasure here, Andrew. - Yeah,
long time coming. go-to source things respiration. mean,
breathe own, want understand breathe brain
breathing interact, person call. - Well, best. know,
lot don't understand, still keeps employed engaged,
know lot. - don't start off just talking involved generating


breath. would, comment mechanisms rhythmic
breathing versus non rhythmic breathing? - Okay, mechanical side,
obvious everyone, want air flow in, inhale, need air flow
reason need body metabolism, need oxygen.
oxygen utilized aerobic metabolic process, produce carbon
dioxide. so, get rid carbon dioxide produce particular
carbon dioxide affects acid base balance blood, pH,
living cells sensitive pH value is, body interested
regulating pH. enough oxygen normal metabolism,
get rid CO2 produce. So, generate air flow?
Well, air comes lungs. expand lungs lungs
expand, basically, like balloon pull apart. pressure inside
balloon drops air will flow balloon. expand, put pressure
lungs pull apart, lowers pressure air sacks called alveoli air will
flow pressure outside body higher pressure inside body
expansion, inhaling. produces that? Well,
principle muscle diaphragm, sitting inside body just lung,
want inhale, basically contract diaphragm pulls down.
pulls down, inserting pressure forces lung, lung wants
expand. time, rib cage going rotate out, therefore
expanding cavity, thoracic cavity. end inspiration, normal
conditions aggressed, just relax like pulling spring.
pull spring let go relax. So, inhale exhale. Inhale, relax,
exhale. - So, exhale passive? - rest passive. get
happens need increase amount air bringing
ventilation, metabolism goes like exercise. Now muscles themselves,
skeletal muscles don't anything unless nervous system tells
something. nervous system tells something, contract. So,
specialized neurons spinal cord, spinal cord,
region called brainstem, go respiratory muscles, particular inspiration
diaphragm external intercostal muscles rib cage. contract.
So, respiratory muscles inspiratory muscles become active
become active period time,



00:14:35 Neural Control Breathing: “Pre-Botzinger Complex”

become silent become silent, muscles relax back
original resting level. activity neurons innovate
muscle, called motor neurons, originate? Well,
question bandied around thousands years,
beginning assistant professor, fairly high priority try figure out,
wanted understand rhythm breathing coming
couldn't know coming knew coming from.
didn't phrase properly. couldn't understand done
know look. So, lot experiments, can go detail
finally found, region brainstem, region sort
spinal cord, critical generating rhythm. called pre-
Botzinger complex. can talk named. small site,
contains humans, thousand neurons, located either side works
tandem every breath begins neurons region beginning active,
neurons connect ultimately motor neurons going diaphragm
external intercostals causing active causing inspiratory
effort. neurons pre-Botzinger complex finish burst activity,
inspiration stops begin

00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing

exhale passive recoil lung rib cage. - just briefly
interrupt ask quick questions - course. - move forward
informative answer. two questions are, anything known
activation diaphragm intercostal muscles ribs relates
nose versus mouth breathing, activated equivalent way, regardless
whether not someone breathing nose mouth? - don't think fully
answer that. Clearly differences nasal mouth
breathing. rest tendency nasal breathing air flows
necessary normal breathing easily managed passing nasal
cavities. However, ventilation needs increase like exercise,
need move air, mouth airways much


larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide

take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early

work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes

super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big

normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,

got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative

crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less

essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing

sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got
next door colleague. - Right. - Yeah. - said, "Why asking this?"
said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio
victims iron lungs principal deficit no hyperinflation
lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people
will overdose drugs various kinds stopped breathing. So,
barbiturates, alcohol combined barbiturates common cause death drug

evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine

maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able

certainly possibility, not investigated. mean, one things

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested

mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

breath. would, comment mechanisms rhythmic
breathing versus non rhythmic breathing? - Okay, mechanical side,
obvious everyone, want air flow in, inhale, need air flow
reason need body metabolism, need oxygen.
oxygen utilized aerobic metabolic process, produce carbon
dioxide. so, get rid carbon dioxide produce particular
carbon dioxide affects acid base balance blood, pH,
living cells sensitive pH value is, body interested
regulating pH. enough oxygen normal metabolism,
get rid CO2 produce. So, generate air flow?
Well, air comes lungs. expand lungs lungs
expand, basically, like balloon pull apart. pressure inside
balloon drops air will flow balloon. expand, put pressure
lungs pull apart, lowers pressure air sacks called alveoli air will
flow pressure outside body higher pressure inside body
expansion, inhaling. produces that? Well,
principle muscle diaphragm, sitting inside body just lung,
want inhale, basically contract diaphragm pulls down.
pulls down, inserting pressure forces lung, lung wants
expand. time, rib cage going rotate out, therefore
expanding cavity, thoracic cavity. end inspiration, normal
conditions aggressed, just relax like pulling spring.
pull spring let go relax. So, inhale exhale. Inhale, relax,
exhale. - So, exhale passive? - rest passive. get
happens need increase amount air bringing
ventilation, metabolism goes like exercise. Now muscles themselves,
skeletal muscles don't anything unless nervous system tells
something. nervous system tells something, contract. So,
specialized neurons spinal cord, spinal cord,
region called brainstem, go respiratory muscles, particular inspiration
diaphragm external intercostal muscles rib cage. contract.
So, respiratory muscles inspiratory muscles become active
become active period time,

tandem every breath begins neurons region beginning active,
neurons connect ultimately motor neurons going diaphragm
external intercostals causing active causing inspiratory

inspiration stops begin

00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing

exhale passive recoil lung rib cage. - just briefly
interrupt ask quick questions - course. - move forward
informative answer. two questions are, anything known
activation diaphragm intercostal muscles ribs relates
nose versus mouth breathing, activated equivalent way, regardless
whether not someone breathing nose mouth? - don't think fully
answer that. Clearly differences nasal mouth
breathing. rest tendency nasal breathing air flows
necessary normal breathing easily managed passing nasal
cavities. However, ventilation needs increase like exercise,
need move air, mouth airways much


larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort

various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid

sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses

direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond

expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide

cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative

crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,

grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule

okay, walking door, remember experiments described

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

00:14:35 Neural Control Breathing: “Pre-Botzinger Complex”

become silent become silent, muscles relax back
original resting level. activity neurons innovate
muscle, called motor neurons, originate? Well,
question bandied around thousands years,
beginning assistant professor, fairly high priority try figure out,
wanted understand rhythm breathing coming
couldn't know coming knew coming from.
didn't phrase properly. couldn't understand done
know look. So, lot experiments, can go detail
finally found, region brainstem, region sort
spinal cord, critical generating rhythm. called pre-
Botzinger complex. can talk named. small site,
contains humans, thousand neurons, located either side works
tandem every breath begins neurons region beginning active,
neurons connect ultimately motor neurons going diaphragm
external intercostals causing active causing inspiratory
effort. neurons pre-Botzinger complex finish burst activity,
inspiration stops begin

00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing

exhale passive recoil lung rib cage. - just briefly
interrupt ask quick questions - course. - move forward
informative answer. two questions are, anything known
activation diaphragm intercostal muscles ribs relates
nose versus mouth breathing, activated equivalent way, regardless
whether not someone breathing nose mouth? - don't think fully
answer that. Clearly differences nasal mouth
breathing. rest tendency nasal breathing air flows
necessary normal breathing easily managed passing nasal
cavities. However, ventilation needs increase like exercise,
need move air, mouth airways much


larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain

respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw

experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond

next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less

essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became

just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion

like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

larger then, therefore can move much air, level
intercostals diaphragm, contraction not, almost agnostic whether
not nose mouth open. - Okay, understand correctly, no reason
suspect particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets neurons
pre-Botzinger area brainstem triggered nasal versus mouth inhales? - No,
say not pre-Botzinger complex not concerned cannot
influence that, not appear modulation whether not
air coming from, whether coming nasal passages
mouth. - Great. Thank you.

00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles

question intercostal muscles ribs
move ribs understand correctly, diaphragm,
skeletal Brits say, skeletal muscles smooth muscles? type
muscle talking here? - said earlier, skeletal, didn't say
skeletal muscles, muscles need neural input order move.
talked smooth muscles. specialized muscles like gut
heart, muscles capable actually contracting relaxing
own. So, heart beats, doesn't need neural input order beat.
neural inputs modulate strength frequency, beat own.
skeletal muscles involved breathing need neural input. Now, smooth
muscles influence breathing, muscles lining
airways. so, airways smooth muscle become activated,
smooth muscle can contract relax, contract inappropriately
problems breathing like asthma. Asthma condition get
inappropriate constriction smooth muscles airways. - So, no reason
think asthma pre-Botzinger neuronal centers brain
activate breathing, involved causal things like asthma? -
now, say preponderance evidence not involved, not
really fully investigated that. - Thank you. Sorry break flow, terribly
interested knowing answers

00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus



questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond

expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide

cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative

crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels

point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health

sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed

grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule

great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come

okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is

my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone

time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30

pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,

basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one

questions provided them, thank you. - Now, remind again,
my- - just landing pre-Botzinger will return naming
pre-Botzinger wonderful important story really, think people
aware of. maybe march us brain centers
discovered others worked well control breathing, pre-Botzinger
well related structures. - Okay. So, discovered pre-Botzinger,
thought primary source rhythmic respiratory movements,
inspiration expiration. notion single source like day night. like
coming, origin Earth rotates day follows
night thought pre-Botzinger complex inhalation, exhalation.
series experiments early part 2000, discovered
seemed another region dominant producing expiratory
movements, exhalation. made fundamental mistake
discovery pre-Botzinger, not taking account rest expiratory muscle
activity exhalation passive. So, case, group neurons might
generate active expiration, contract expiratory muscles, like abdominal
muscles internal intercostals just silent. just thought wasn't, air
coming one place, got evidence fact, may coming
another place. following experiments, discovered
second oscillator oscillator involved generating call active
expiration. act of- - go [exhales]. - Yeah [exhales], begin
exercise, go [panting], actually move air out. group cells,
silent rest suddenly becomes active drive muscles, appears
independent oscillator when- - Maybe just clarify people
oscillator is. - Okay, oscillator something goes cycle. So, can
pendulum oscillator going back forth. Earth oscillator
goes around day night. - people's moods oscillating. - Oscillating.
depends regular are. can oscillators highly regular
watch, can sporadic episodic. Breathing one
oscillators life working continuously 24/7. starts late
third trimester working born, basically works
throughout life stops, no intervention beyond minutes, will likely
fatal. - second oscillator called? - Well, found region around


facial nucleus, initially, region initially identified, thought
involved sensing carbon dioxide. call central chemo receptor.
is, want keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly brain relatively
stable level 'cause brain extraordinarily sensitive changes pH. big
shift carbon dioxide there'll big shift brain pH, that'll throw brain,
can use technical term, whack. so, want regulate way
regulate something brain sensor brain. others basically
identified ventral surface brainstem, part brainstem
side, critical identified structure near
trapezoid nucleus. not named noranatomical atlases, just
picked name hat called retro trapezoid nucleus. -
clarify people. Jack saying trapezoid, doesn't mean trapezoid muscles.
Trapezoid refers shape nucleus, cluster neurons. Parafacial makes
think general area involved something related mouth face.
area rich neurons controlling parts face, eye blinks, nose twitches, lip
curls, lip smacks? - go back evolutionary sense lot things
hard figure begin make sense look evolution nervous
system. control facial muscles, going back primitive creatures
take things mouth eating, call face sort
developed, eyes there, mouth there, nuclei, modem
contained motor neurons, lot control systems developed
immediate vicinity. So, think face, lot sudden nuclei around
various roles various different times evolution. one point
evolution, facial muscles probably important moving fluid
mouth moving air mouth, part many different
sub nuclei

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw

experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond

next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less

essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

00:26:20 Breathe Special (Compared Non-Mammals)

now seems mammals involved control expiratory muscles.
remember mammals special comes breathing,
class vertebrates diaphragm. look amphibians
reptiles, don't diaphragm. way breathe not actively
inspiring passively expiring. breathe actively expiring passively


inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,

like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got

And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear

basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found

my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,

highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based

length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion

disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

inspiring don't powerful inspiratory muscle. somewhere along
line, diaphragm developed, lots theories developed.
don't think particularly clear. something can find alligators
lizards turned muscle diaphragm. amazing thing
diaphragm mechanically extremely efficient. mean
that? Well, look oxygen gets outside body bloodstream,
critical passage across membrane lung. called alveolar capillary
membrane. alveolus part lung blood runs capillaries,
smallest tubes circulatory system. point, oxygen can go
air filled alveolus blood. - amazing. find amazing, even though
just purely mechanical, idea little sacks lungs, inhale
air goes literally oxygen can pass bloodstream- - Passes
bloodstream. rate passes will depend characteristics
membrane, distance alveolus blood vessel,
capillary. key element surface area. bigger surface area,
oxygen can pass through, entirely passive process. no magic
making oxygen go in. Now, get pack, large surface area small
chest? Well, start one tube, trachea, trachea expands. Now
two tubes. four tubes keeps branching. point,
end branches, put little sphere, alveolus,
determines surface area going be. Now, mechanical
problem. surface area, able pull apart. So, imagine
little square elastic membrane, doesn't take lot force pull apart,
now increase 50 times, need lot force pull apart. So,
amphibians breathing, not compressing lungs just passively
expanding weren't able generate lot force, relatively branches.
So, look surface area pack lungs relative body size,
not impressive. Whereas get mammals, amount branching
four 500,000,000 alveoli. - take four
5,000,000- - 100,000,000, four 500,000,000. - 100,000,000, excuse me, lay
flat, sort surface area talking about? - 70 square meters,
third size tennis court. - Wow. - membrane inside
third size tennis court actually expand every breath.
without exerting much a, don't feel it,


amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half
liters. need convert quartz? - No. - Right, two half liters.
take breath, taking another 500 milliliters half liter.
size maybe fist. So, increasing volume 20%,
pulling 70 square meter membrane. enough bring enough fresh air
lung mix air already there, oxygen levels
bloodstream goes partial pressure oxygen, 40 millimeters mercury
100 millimeters mercury. So, huge increase oxygen enough
sustain normal metabolism. So, amazing mechanical advantage
diaphragm. - think brains larger mammals
part, amount oxygen able bring system?
- say key step ability develop large brain continuous
demand oxygen diaphragm. Without diaphragm, amphibian,
another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small
lung, pliant rib cage, now develop adult,
stiffer rib cage. so, changes happening brain body,
neural control breathing change fly. not like things like
vision opportunity sleep sleeping, brain
capable things not easy wakefulness, like
construction crew comes sleep. change breathing described
trying build airplane flying. - Basically Jack saying
respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,

asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative

crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing

sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got

said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio

maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found

my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less

lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal

going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can

question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle

can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things

say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way

amazing muscle, diaphragm, positioning just moving two
thirds inch able expand membrane enough move air
lungs. Now, rest, - Wow. - volume air lungs two half

another solution increasing oxygen uptake way birds breathe,
birds limitations still can't get brains big mammals have. So,
brain utilizes maybe 20% oxygen intake needs
continuously. brain doesn't want neglected. So, puts certain demands
breathing system. words, can't shut awhile, poses
issues. born, mature. small body, small

respiration science complex hardworking vision science,
direct jab might've missed, definitely not miss,
appreciate always take opportunity

00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements Breathing



like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed

Kevin's great kid, enjoy talking smart guy, found
academia smartest people want hire people smarter

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found

my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested

mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities

signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together

like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt

like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became

disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations
relates health neuroscience forth that, one


colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also

more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise

extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls

transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots

threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues

like good New Yorker give good, healthy intellectual jab. question related
diaphragmatic breathing versus non diaphragmatic breathing way
describe it, diaphragm always involved years whether yoga
class breathwork thing, hear online breathing
diaphragm, rather lifting rib cage breathe [inhales] chest,
"healthier" air quotes better somehow belly expand
inhale. not aware particular studies really examined direct health
benefits diaphragmatic versus non diaphragmatic breathing, don't mind
commenting anything aware relates diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing, whether not people tend diaphragmatic breathers
default, et cetera, be, think interesting number people. - Well, think
default, obligate diaphragm breathers. may pathologies
diaphragm compromised use muscles, challenge.
Certainly rest muscles can take over, need increase
ventilation, diaphragm important. hard increase ventilation
otherwise. - pay attention whether not breathing manner
belly goes little bit inhale, can ways, right? can
inhale [inhales], bring belly in, can inhale [inhales], push diaphragm belly
out. Not diaphragm out, interesting, right? completely
different muscle set version. - Well, context things like breath practice,
bit agnostic effects different patterns breathing.
Clearly, going work different mechanisms, can talk
that, certain level example, whether primarily diaphragm move
abdomen not, agnostic it. think changes breathing
induces emotion cognition, different ideas influence
don't see primarily how, particular muscles choosing, just
prejudice.

00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin

- Okay. will return general theme little bit. want ask
sighing. One many great gifts given us years
understanding things call physiological sighs. tell us
physiological sighs? known them, particular interest


good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got

And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio

lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people

evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine
sighs don't happen consequence drug impacting brain centers,

maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control

together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence

that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo

good for? - interesting important question. So, everyone
sense sigh is. certainly, emotional, ways
stressed, particularly happy, [inhales] take little sigh. turns
sighing time. ask people not particularly
knowledgeable read papers James Nestor's book listened
podcast, usually off two orders magnitude frequently sigh
low side. words, say hour, 10 times day. sigh
every five minutes, encourage anyone finds unbelievable
fact, lie quiet room just breathe normally, just relax, just let go,
just pay attention breathing find every couple minutes,
[inhales] taking deep breath can't stop it. just happens. Now, why? Well,
go back lung again. lung 500,000,000 alveoli,
tiny. 200 microns across. So, really, really tiny. can think
fluid filled. fluid lined. reason fluid lined
esoterica mechanics that. makes little easier stretch fluid
line, called surfactant. surfactant important development,
determining factor the, premature infants born. not not
lung surfactant makes much challenging take care
lung surfactant, sometime, remember correctly, late second,
early third trimester, appears. case fluid line. Now, think balloon
blow up, now blow up, fill balloon water,
squeeze water now, squeeze water notice
sides balloon stick other. that? Well, water
called surface tension. two surfaces water together,
actually tend stick other. Now, try blow balloon up,
know it, notice ever done before, balloon little harder
inflate dry inside. that? overcome
surface tension. Well, alveoli tendency collapse. 500,000,000
them. not collapsing high rate, slow rate not trivial.
alveolus collapses no longer can receive oxygen take carbon dioxide
out. sort taken equation. Now, 500,000,000
lose 10, no big deal, keep collapsing, can lose significant part
surface area lung. Now, normal breath not enough pop open,
take [inhales] deep breath pops open. - nose mouth? -


Doesn't matter. - Okay. - Doesn't matter. - Or- - just increased lung volume 'cause
just pulling lungs, pop open every every five minutes. so,
every five minutes order maintain health lung. early
days mechanical ventilation, used treat polio victims weakness
respiratory muscles, put big steel tubes way
work pressure outside body drop. put expansion
pressure lungs, excuse me, rib cage. rib cage expand
lung expand. pressure go back normal lung
rib cage go back normal. great getting ventilation,
relatively high mortality rate. bit mystery. one solution just give
bigger breaths. give bigger breaths mortality rate dropped, wasn't
think '50s realized didn't increase every
breath big. needed every often one big
breath. So, couple minutes normal breaths, one big breath just
mimicking physiological sighs, mortality rate dropped significantly.
see someone ventilator hospital, watch every couple minutes
see membrane move down, every couple minutes there'll
super breath pops open. So, mechanisms
physiological sighs. So, just like collapse lungs, need big
pressure pop open, thing alveola. need bigger pressure
normal breath not enough. So, take big inhale. [Jack inhales]
[Jack exhales] nature done instead requiring us remember it,
automatically. every five minutes. one questions
asked happening? every five minutes? it?
got back door. Typical way lot science gets done.
serendipitous event run across paper something clicks just,
follow up. Sometimes go blind ends, turned incredibly
productive. One guys lab reading paper stress,
stress lots things happen body, one hypothalamus,
reactive body state releases peptides, specialized molecules,
circulate throughout brain body, particular effects usually help deal
better stress. one class peptides released called
Bombesin related peptides. also realize breathing guy,
stressed sigh more. said, "All right, maybe related."


Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got
next door colleague. - Right. - Yeah. - said, "Why asking this?"
said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio
victims iron lungs principal deficit no hyperinflation
lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people
will overdose drugs various kinds stopped breathing. So,
barbiturates, alcohol combined barbiturates common cause death drug
users contra-indications drugs, kinds things. hear time
celebrities dying combined alcohol barbiturates.
evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine
sighs don't happen consequence drug impacting brain centers,
one cause basically asphyxiation death. - look


progression mammal death, find breathing slows down, death
due natural causes, breathing slows down, will stop, gasp. So,
phrase dying gasp [inhales]. Super large breaths. often described
attempt auto resuscitate, take super deep breath
maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able
re-arouse breathing, prevented, don't get re-aroused. So,
certainly possibility, not investigated. mean, one things
interested individuals diseases, will affect pre-Botzinger
complex. data Parkinson's disease multiple system atrophy,
another form neurodegeneration loss neurons pre-Botzinger.
question is, also may happen ALS, sometimes referred Lou Gehrig's
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. individuals often die sleep.
idea not able get anyone test patients
Parkinson's, patients MLS typically breathe normally wakefulness.
disturbances breathing sleep. So, Parkinson's patients
end stages disease often significant disturbances sleep pattern,
not wakefulness. think happening proximate
cause death not heart failure, become apneic. stop breathing
don't resuscitate. resuscitation may may not due explicit
suppression sighs, overall suppression whole apparatus pre-
Botzinger complex. - Got it. Thank you. So, Yackle calls up. - So, calls
he's, great kid, super smart, tells experiments
looking database try find molecules enriched
regions brain critical breathing. So, others mapped
regions brainstem, looking one databases see
enriched. said, "That's great. Will willing sort share work
together?" says, "No, advisor doesn't want that." said, "Okay,"
Kevin's great kid, enjoy talking smart guy, found
academia smartest people want hire people smarter
preference interact people smarter them. faculty not
highest level every institution, distribution. One's mean,
mean, mean threatened that.


saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

Bombesin relatively cheap buy. said, buy Bombesin throw
brainstem, see happens." one nice things
experiments try design fail quickly. idea, throw
Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,
might need censored, said, "Look this." rat.
Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put
Bombesin pre-Botzinger complex. - [Andrew] Amazing. - way
took very, fine glass needle anesthetized rat, inserted needle
directly pre-Botzinger complex. So, wasn't internalized delivery
peptide. localized pre-Botzinger, sigh rate went roof. -
add important experiment deliver Bombesin directly
site one concluded injection Bombesin
increased sighing increased stress rather directly increased sighing. -
Amongst hundreds possible interpretations. So, precision
important, goes back said beginning, knowing
happening allows proper investigations. didn't know
inspiratory rhythm originating, never done experiment.
so, another experiment. said, "Okay, happens take cells
pre-Botzinger responding peptides? So, neurons will respond
peptide specialized receptors peptide. not every neuron
expresses receptors. pre-Botzinger complex, probably hundred
thousands. So, used technique used before, technique
developed Doug Laffey San Diego, take peptide
conjugate molecule called saporin. Saporin plant derived molecule,
cousin ricin. many listeners may heard ricin and- -
ribosomal toxin. - nasty. single stab umbrella will kill you,
something supposedly happened Bulgarian diplomat Russian operative
bridge London. got stabbed way ricin works goes inside cell,
crosses cell membrane, goes inside cell, kills cell, goes next cell
next cell, next cell. extremely dangerous. fact,
virtually impossible work lab United States. won't let touch it. -


Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical

stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got
next door colleague. - Right. - Yeah. - said, "Why asking this?"
said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio
victims iron lungs principal deficit no hyperinflation
lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people
will overdose drugs various kinds stopped breathing. So,
barbiturates, alcohol combined barbiturates common cause death drug

evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine
sighs don't happen consequence drug impacting brain centers,
one cause basically asphyxiation death. - look


progression mammal death, find breathing slows down, death
due natural causes, breathing slows down, will stop, gasp. So,
phrase dying gasp [inhales]. Super large breaths. often described
attempt auto resuscitate, take super deep breath
maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able

certainly possibility, not investigated. mean, one things

he's, great kid, super smart, tells experiments
looking database try find molecules enriched
regions brain critical breathing. So, others mapped
regions brainstem, looking one databases see

Kevin's great kid, enjoy talking smart guy, found

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can

question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration

can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component

whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral

big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature

oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-

looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not

monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way

Bombesin Bombesin nothin', nothing lost, maybe $50 buy
Bombesin. something might interest. So, one afternoon
experiment comes me, says, won't quote exactly said,

Rats sigh every two minutes. smaller need sigh
often. sigh rate went 20 30 per hour 500 per hour put

anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not

Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less

okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is

my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response

well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary

According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically
compound, sold commercially. So, compound sold
commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

Ricin? - Ricin 'cause- - worked saporin many times. - Saporin safe
doesn't cross cell membranes. So, got injection saporin, won't
anything stays outside cells. - Please, nobody that, even though
doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saporin whether not
operative otherwise. - Thank you, Andrew, protecting there. So, Doug
Laffey figured ligand binds receptor, molecule binds
receptor, many cases receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside cell.
So, goes membrane cell inside cell. - Sort like can't go
dance alone, coupled up, get door. - right. So,
figured put saporin peptide, peptide binds receptor, gets
internalized inside cell, saporin thing ricin
does. kills cell, can't go next cell. So, cells get
killed, polite term ablated, cells express receptor. So,
big conglomeration cells, thousand 50
express receptor, inject saporin conjugated ligand
peptide, 50 cells die. So, took Bombesin conjugated saporin,
inject pre-Botzinger complex rats, took couple days
saporin actually ablate cells. happened mice started sighing less
less, excuse me, rats started sighing less less less less,
essentially stopped signing. - So, student postdoc, it? Murdered cells,
consequence,

00:49:39 Don’t Sigh, Lung (& General) Health Suffers

sighing goes away. - Right. - consequence eliminating sighing
internal state behavior rats? they, words, one can't sigh,
generate physiological sighs, consequence state mind?
imagine carbon dioxide build readily higher levels
bloodstream animals stressed. kind logical
extension way set up. - less benign that. animals got
point weren't sighing then, not determine this,
presumption lung function significantly deteriorated, whole health
deteriorated significantly sacrifice them. So, can't tell whether
stressed not, breathing got significantly deteriorated


sacrificed point. Now, don't know whether specifically related
fact didn't sigh secondary damage due fact
cells die, never determined that. Now, study, candid,
wasn't high priority us get door publish it. So, stayed
shelf. got phone call graduate student Stanford, Kevin Yackle,
starts askin' interesting questions breathing, happy
answer point concerned working renowned
biochemist worked lung drosophila, fruit flies, Mark Krasnow. - Yeah, got
next door colleague. - Right. - Yeah. - said, "Why asking this?"
said, "I undergraduate UCLA gave lecture undergraduate
class curious breathing ever since." So, one things
professor, love hear actually something really affected life
student. - birthed competitor, blame. - No,
don't look competitor. think enough interesting things go on.
know neuroscience colleagues say, "You can work lab,
leave lab, got work something different." - No one ever trained
would've said that. open field. want work something, hop mix. -
And, people like that, neuroscientists like that. never felt that- - hear
breathing apparati disrupted causes brain dysfunction leads
behavior just described. actually not true, terms the- - So- - So,
talk beautiful story Yackle Krasnow Feldman Lab,
want just make sure understand. So, physiological sighs don't happen,
basically breathing overall suffers? - Well, go back observations polio
victims iron lungs principal deficit no hyperinflation
lungs many deteriorated died. - just stay one
moment moved describe, hear often people
will overdose drugs various kinds stopped breathing. So,
barbiturates, alcohol combined barbiturates common cause death drug
users contra-indications drugs, kinds things. hear time
celebrities dying combined alcohol barbiturates.
evidence sighs occurred sleep states deep, deep
relaxation sedation sighs recover brain? can imagine
sighs don't happen consequence drug impacting brain centers,
one cause basically asphyxiation death. - look


progression mammal death, find breathing slows down, death
due natural causes, breathing slows down, will stop, gasp. So,
phrase dying gasp [inhales]. Super large breaths. often described
attempt auto resuscitate, take super deep breath
maybe can kickstart engine again. not know degree things
gasp really sighs particularly large. so, suppress ability
gasp individual subject overdose, whereas might able
re-arouse breathing, prevented, don't get re-aroused. So,
certainly possibility, not investigated. mean, one things
interested individuals diseases, will affect pre-Botzinger

he's, great kid, super smart, tells experiments
looking database try find molecules enriched
regions brain critical breathing. So, others mapped
regions brainstem, looking one databases see
enriched. said, "That's great. Will willing sort share work
together?" says, "No, advisor doesn't want that." said, "Okay,"
Kevin's great kid, enjoy talking smart guy, found
academia smartest people want hire people smarter
preference interact people smarter them. faculty not
highest level every institution, distribution. One's mean,
mean, mean threatened that.


saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient

exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project

'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give

just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based

length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.

even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,

partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps

Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule

great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science

okay, walking door, remember experiments described

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,

know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"

breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put

Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put

well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary

According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just

magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left

finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule

great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo

course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

saw Kevin like shining light, didn't care whether going out-
compete whatever going help field,
whatever can help him, work Kevin. So, one point got invited give
grand rounds neurology Stanford. turns undergraduate student
worked now head training program neurologists Stanford
invited me. end visit, go Mark Krasnow's office, Kevin
there, post-doc punctually also working project there.
towards end conversation, Mark says me, "We found one molecule
highly concentrated important region breathing." said, "Oh,
great. it?" says, "I can't tell want work it." So,
course disappointed, realized ethic areas science
custom areas science get publication, relatively
restricted sharing information. - Mark going chat come
back. - Okay, right. - Yeah. - Well, may remember story differently, said
okay, walking door, remember experiments described
Bombesin, unusual molecule working. So, reason
rushing door flight catch. So, stick head said, "Is
molecule related Bombesin?" run off, don't even wait
reply. can it. Mark calls says, "Bombesin? peptide found
related Bombesin. do?" said, "I'm not telling." [Andrew laughs] - Oh
my. glad wasn't involved collaboration. - No, no, sort
tease 'cause said, "Well, work together this."

01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions

worked together this. - prisoner's dilemma point, yeah.
So, Kevin Yackle spectacular, lab UCF, work familiar
Kevin worth mentioning now, ask mention it,
reciprocal relationship brain state, even say emotional state
breathing. love get thoughts breathing interacts things
brain. beautifully described breathing controls lungs,
diaphragm, interactions oxygen carbon dioxide forth.
know, get stressed, breathing changes. happy relaxed,
breathing changes. also change breathing, we, sense can


adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,

control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car

feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo

Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just

adjust internal state. relationship brain state breathing?
would, know particular love one particular aspect
this, relationship brain rhythms, oscillations will,
breathing? - topic really intrigued past decade.
say silo, just interested rhythm breathing
generated, didn't really pay much attention stuff. reason got
interested it, think triggered article "The New York Times"
mindfulness. Now, believe not, although lived California 20 years
time, never heard mindfulness. staggering isolated can real
world. Googled mindfulness institute UCLA,
giving courses meditation. said, "Oh, great can now see whether
not breathing part meditation anything purported effects
meditation." signed course, joked before, two goals.
One see whether not breathing effect, levitate
grew Kung Fu things monks levitate
meditated, not? motto lab, can't anything
interesting afraid failing, fail levitate, well, least tried.
tell now, still haven't done yet, haven't given yet. - Yet. - Yet.
haven't given up. So, took course mindfulness became apparent
breathing part actually critical. wasn't simply distraction focus.
move index finger effect. Really believed
breathing part involved. Now, not unbiased observer question is,
can demonstrate that? didn't feel competent experiments humans,
didn't feel design right experiments humans, felt maybe can study
rodents. got idea going teach rodents meditate
laughable, said, can, can actually study
happens. So, believe not, able get sort startup grant, R21
NCCIH, National Complementary Medicine Institute. - wonderful institute
mention. government puts major tax dollars toward studies things like
meditation, breathwork, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. think not well-known,
incredible thing government that, think deserves nod
funding [chuckles]. - totally agree you. think kind thing
many us, including many scientists thinks woo woo unsubstantiated,
learning more. used laugh neuroimmunology, nervous


system didn't anything immune system pain can influence
immune system. mean, things learning use
dismiss, think real nuggets learned here. So, went limb
funded particular project.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

01:57:13 Dr. Feldman’s Breathwork Protocols, Post-Lunch



cognitive function. fortunate case. - terrific
segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.
may particular kinds practices can use helpful optimizing
performance sport. not yet. find get tremendous benefit relatively
short periods five maybe 20 minutes box breathing.
simple do. simple app, helps keep timing. - recall
app is? Apnea Trainer? one? - Well, using Calm long
time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30
minutes day, breath patterns stars like Wim Hof
little intimidating newbies. so, like see something simple,
tell friends is, look, just try five 10 minutes. See feel better,
days. don't like it, stop it, doesn't cost anything. invariably, find
helpful. will often interrupt day take five 10 minutes. Like, find


lagging... think pretty good data performance lunch
declines. so, often lunch, didn't today take five
10 minutes just sort breath practice. - lately, breath practice
look like? - just box breathing five 10 minutes. - duration
inhales holds exhales holds set app? right? - Well, five
seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second
hold. - Yeah, sometimes doubles. 10 seconds just get bored.
just, feel like helpful. mean... Now, not thing
respect trying maintain sanity health. - No, can imagine there'd
number things, although, seem sane healthy,
fact, know things.

02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol

- Right, suspect am. - suspect data. Awhile back
conversation, casual conversation, said something really stuck
mind, might specific pattern breathwork one not
important experiencing transitions states based deliberate breathwork
something extent, interpreted mean box breathing
five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold couple
days, maybe even couple minutes switch 10 seconds
switch Tummo, something powerful perhaps transitions
realizing relationship different patterns breathing transitions,
much way can get one cars amusement park
just goes constant rate stops. different learning shift
gears. used drive manual. still can thinking manual transmission,
even automatic transmission, start get sense vehicle
behaves different conditions. thought beautiful seed
potential breathwork practice least awareness, nobody really
formalized, introduce variability within practice
somewhat random order able sense relationship different speeds
depths inhales, exhales holds forth. essentially, like driving
around track, obstacles different rates breaking restarting
things sort, learn drive. think


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different
breathing practices affecting outcomes different pathways.
olfactory pathway, central pathway, vagal pathway,
descending pathway, different practices may change summation
things think things probably involved, just
beginning scratch surface. just hope can get serious neuroscientists
psychologists right experiments get think lot
value human health here. - too, one reasons lab shifted
sorts things humans. delighted continuing
hardcore mechanistic work mice probably work humans already well,
not already. groups, Epel Lab UCF, number of,
starting see papers

02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory

respiration humans little bit, brain imaging. can't help ask
somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations
relates health neuroscience forth that, one


colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically
compound, sold commercially. So, compound sold
commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear

now going leap ahead three years threw stuff
wall didn't work. recently major breakthrough. found protocol
can get mice breathe slowly, awake mice breathe slowly. won't tell you. -
Normally don't breathe slowly. - No, no. words, whatever normal
breath is, slow factor 10 fine that. So,
for, 30 minutes day four weeks, okay? Like breath
practice. - levitate? - haven't measured yet [laughs]. say
priority, haven't seen floating top cage, haven't weighed
them. Maybe weigh less. Maybe levitation graded. so, maybe weigh
less sort partial levitation. case, tested them. control
animals, mice, everything same, except manipulation made
not slow breathing. So, went everything else. put
standard air conditioning, colleague, Michael
Fanselow, one real gurus fear. measured standard test put
mice condition concerned receive shock response
freeze, measure fearful long freeze.
well validated way pay grade describe validity test,
valid. control mice freezing time, just ordinary
mice have. ones went protocol froze much, much less.
According Michael, degree showed less freezing much
major manipulation amygdala, part brain
important fear processing. staggering change. problem now
grant ran money, postdoc working left, now try piece
together everything, data spectacular. - Well, think it's, just pause
moment think the, talking rodent study, think
benefits rodent study can get deep mechanism people
might think, well, known meditation benefits, need


get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates

[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became

transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,

basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one

get mechanistic science? think one thing important people
remember first all, many people one might think meditating
breathwork, far, far, far, far greater number people not, right? mean,
majority people don't take time dedicated breathwork meditate. So,
whatever can incentivize people wonderful. thing never
really clear just much meditation required real effect, meaning
practical effect. People say 30 minutes day, 20 minutes day, week, twice
week, thing breathwork. Finding minimum effective thresholds changing
neural circuitry think holy grail practices. going
determined sorts mechanistic studies described. So,
wonderful. hope work gets completed can talk ways can
ensure happens, but- - let add one thing saying, Andrew.
One issues, think lot people placebo effect.
humans, can respond something even though mechanism nothing
intervention is. so, easy say meditative response
big component, placebo effect. mice don't believe placebo effect.
so, show bonafide effect mice, convincing ways
no matter many human experiments did, control placebo effect
extremely difficult humans. mice, non-issue. So, think
enormous message send. - Excellent, indeed, better point. think
30 minute day meditation mice, understand correctly, meditation,
don't know thinking about, but- - Well, breath practice really. - Right,
breath practice. So, presumably not thinking third eye
center, lotus position, levitation, whatever is. not instructed do,
were, probably wouldn't anyway. So, 30 minutes day
breathing deliberately slowed slowed relative normal patterns
breathing. Got it. frequency sighing 30 minutes? Unclear? -
don't know yet. - Oh. - Well, no, data.

01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing

just, analyzing data. - determined, announced
point. So, fear centers altered way creates shorter fear response
foot shock. - [Jack] Right. - examples aware


work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.
may particular kinds practices can use helpful optimizing
performance sport. not yet. find get tremendous benefit relatively
short periods five maybe 20 minutes box breathing.
simple do. simple app, helps keep timing. - recall
app is? Apnea Trainer? one? - Well, using Calm long
time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30
minutes day, breath patterns stars like Wim Hof
little intimidating newbies. so, like see something simple,
tell friends is, look, just try five 10 minutes. See feel better,
days. don't like it, stop it, doesn't cost anything. invariably, find
helpful. will often interrupt day take five 10 minutes. Like, find


lagging... think pretty good data performance lunch

10 minutes just sort breath practice. - lately, breath practice
look like? - just box breathing five 10 minutes. - duration
inhales holds exhales holds set app? right? - Well, five
seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second

02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol

- Right, suspect am. - suspect data. Awhile back

something extent, interpreted mean box breathing
five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold couple
days, maybe even couple minutes switch 10 seconds
switch Tummo, something powerful perhaps transitions
realizing relationship different patterns breathing transitions,
much way can get one cars amusement park
just goes constant rate stops. different learning shift

even automatic transmission, start get sense vehicle

potential breathwork practice least awareness, nobody really
formalized, introduce variability within practice
somewhat random order able sense relationship different speeds

around track, obstacles different rates breaking restarting
things sort, learn drive. think


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different

work laboratory work laboratories matter
interactions breathing brain state emotional state? - So, goes back
prior conversation. sort went off tangent. think need think
separately effect volitional changes breathing emotion versus effect
brain state breathing. So, effect brain state breathing like
stressed affect, presumably originating higher centers can use term
affecting breathing. reciprocal change breathing, affects
emotional state. think two things different ultimately tied
together. So, landmark paper published '50s stimulated
amygdala cats, depending stimulated, got profound changes
breathing. like every pattern breathing possibly imagine, found
site amygdala, produce that. So, clearly powerful
descending effect coming amygdala major site processing
emotion, fear, stress whatnot can affect breathing. clearly
volitional control breathing. So, profound effects there. Now, say
emotional control breathing, need segue talking locked-in
syndrome. Locked-in syndrome devastating lesion happens part
brainstem signals controlled muscles transmitted. fibers coming
motor cortex go part brainstem, called ventral
pons. stroke there, can damage pathways. happens
individuals locked-in syndrome lose volitional movement except
lateral movement eyes maybe ability blink. reason able
still blink move eyes control centers rostal, closer to, not
interrupted. words, interruption that. continue breathe
centers breathing don't require volitional command. case,
that, fine. So, people continue breathe. Normal
intelligence, can't move. great book called "The Diving Bell
Butterfly" young man happens to, describes life
real testament human condition this. remarkable book,
short book. - write book blinking? translate it? -
blinking caretaker. pretty amazing. movie never
seen Javier Bardem protagonist, book highly recommend
anyone read. So, colleagues studying individual locked-in syndrome
they, patient breathed robotically, totally consistent, regular.


gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see

actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps

Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside

lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just

gave patient low oxygen mixture breathe. Ventilation went up, CO2 mixture
breathe, ventilation went up. So, regulatory apparatus breathing there.
asked patient hold breath breathe faster [blows raspberry]. Nothing
happened. Just patient recognized command, couldn't change it.
sudden, patient's breathing changed considerably, said patient,
"What happened?" said, "You told joke laughed." went back
whenever told joke patient found funny, patient's breathing pattern
changed. know breathing pattern laugh [inhales] inhale,
go ha, ha, ha, ha. also distinctive. neuroscience
colleagues will go un-named, who, heard laugh 50 yards away,
know exactly are. - Yeah, well, name him. Eric Kandel, - one. -
inspiratory laugh. famous [inhaling], opposed ha, ha. - Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. So, stereotyped, maintained people lose volitional
control breathing. So, emotive component controlling breathing,
nothing volitional control,

01:16:25 Facial Expressions

goes different pathway not disrupted locked-in
syndrome. look motor control face, volitional control
face, also emotional control face, us can't control. So,
look another person, able read lot emotional state
is, lot primates communicate, humans communicate
people good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players. Now
poker players tells, many now wear dark glasses lot
tells blink whatnot. - Pupil sizes stuff. - Pupil size. Pupil size tell,
autonomic function, not skeletal muscle function, skeletal
muscles, controlling, give us away. tried get imaging friends
image great actors Los Angeles. - mean brain
imagers. - Brain imagers, sorry. - Yeah. No, right. - mean, yeah, no, brain
imagers. think ask smile, tell not happy
smiling asked smile. think you're- - thought
crack joke, old friends, so, yeah. - No, not... see
picture like birthday whatnot, say cheese, tell least half


people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift

talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.

time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30

pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort

threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically

commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

people not happy saying cheese, whereas great actor able
dissemble fact sad happy, believe not
faking it. like, great acting. don't think everyone that. think
individuals able connection parts motive
control system rest us don't have. Maybe develop training
maybe not, think can imaged like get one great
actors imager go get normal person,
see whether not can emulate think going find big differences
way control emotive thing. So, emotive control facial muscles,
think large part, similar emotive control breathing. So, emotive
control,

01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness

volitional control different. different. Now, asked
Yackle stuff. Yackle paper ascending, effect
breathing emotion. Kevin found population neurons
pre-Botzinger complex always looking things projecting
ultimately motor neurons. found population cells projected locus
coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, excuse me, one places brain seems
go everywhere. - like sprinkler system. - Exactly, exactly. influence mood,
podcasts this. mean, lot stuff going
amygdala, so, excuse me, locus coeruleus. get locus coeruleus,
can now spray information throughout entire brain. found specific cells
projected pre-Botzinger locus coeruleus, cells inspiratory
modulated. Now, known long time since '60s look
locus coeruleus cats awake, find many neurons
respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention. bother? Not bother paying
attention, brain bother inputs? So, Kevin
Lindsey Schwarz Liqun Luo's lab, killed, ablated, cells going locus
coeruleus pre-Botzinger animals became calmer, EEG levels
changed ways indicative became calmer. - recall,
didn't just become calmer, weren't really capable high arousal states.
kind flat. - don't think really pursued paper. so,


ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone

time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30

like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled

more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired

ask John Huguenard that, I- - side lab ask him.
nonetheless, beautifully illustrates bi-directional control, right?
emotion- - Well, ascending. - Well, no, two stories locked-in syndrome,
plus Yackle paper shows emotional states influence breathing breathing
influences emotional states, which, mentioned inspiration, always call
inhalation, people will follow. No, fine. interchangeable. People can
follow that. interesting papers Noam Sobel's group
number groups inhale right inhale [inhales], brain
actually alert capable storing information exhales, find
incredible also makes sense. able see things far better eyes
open eyelids closed, matter. - Maybe, right? mean, don't
doubt, Noam's work great. Let backtrack bit want people
understand talking breathing affecting emotional cognitive state,
not simply coming pre-Botzinger. least, well, several
sites let sort describe, need sort go that. One olfaction.
So, breathing, normal breathing, inhaling exhaling.
creating signals coming nasal mucosa going back olfactory bulb.
respiratory modulating. olfactory bulb profound influence
projections many parts brain. So, signal arising
rhythmic moving air nose going brain
contained respiratory modulation. So, signal there. brain doesn't
using it, discriminating owner whatnot, riding
oscillation, respiratory related. Another potential source vagus nerve.
vagus nerve major nerve, containing efferents viscera. -
Efferents just being- - signal. - Signals to. - Yes. Signals viscera. also
signals coming brainstem down, called efferents, getting major
signals lung, gut. going brain stem. So, there.
powerful receptors lung responding lung volume.
lungs stretch. - So, bareovers? Oh, sorry. number of, - pressure
receptors. - Like PA0 receptors year's Nobel Prize, yeah. - Yeah. So,
responding expansion relaxation lung. so, record
vagus nerve, see huge respiratory modulation due mechanical
changes lung. Now, interest forms refractory
depression, electrical stimulation vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.


case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo

improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically

make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline

remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

case still remains determined, clear signals vagus
nerve, least artificial signals vagus nerve can positive effect reducing
depression. So, not leap think normal circumstances, rhythm
coming vagus nerve playing role normal processing. Okay, let
continue. Carbon dioxide oxygen levels. Now, normal circumstances,
oxygen levels fine. unless go altitude, don't really change
much, CO2 levels can change quite bit even relatively small change
overall breathing. going change pH level. colleague, Alicia
Maurette, working patients anxious many
hyperventilate. result hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels
low. developed therapeutic treatment trains people
breathe slower restore CO2 levels back normal, gets relief
anxiety. So, CO2 levels, not going affect brain function breath
breath level, although fluctuate breath breath, sort continuous
background can change, changed chronically, know highly elevated
levels CO2 can produce panic attacks. don't know degree gets
exacerbated people panic attack, agree ambient CO2
levels affecting degree discomfort. - people are, tend
calm, meaning feeling sleepy, breathing opposed
over-breathing? knowledge status CO2 system? -
don't know doesn't mean no knowledge, unaware
blissfully unaware. not looked literature, don't know. -
feeling, mean, people, excuse me, scientific literature around
breathing humans aware relates stressed states
little bit easier study lab, whereas people feeling under-stimulated exhausted
time, complicated thing measure. mean, can it, not as- -
Well, CO2's easy measure. - terms sort measures feeling fatigue,
somewhat indirect, whereas stress can get pulse rates HRV things
sort. - Well, imagine devices wearing will soon able
measure, well, now can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation. - Just amazing.
- Yeah, oxygen will pretty much stay 90% unless pathology
go altitude. CO2 levels vary quite bit fact, vary,
body sensitive, control breathing, like much breathe per minute
determined sensitive way CO2 level. So, even small change


CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone

just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion

getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate

that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo

improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically

working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

CO2 will significant effect ventilation. So, another thing not
changes ventilation, affects brain state. Now, another thing
affect breathing, breathing practice can affect emotional state simply
descending command breathing practice involves volitional control
breathing, therefore signal originating somewhere motor
cortex. not, course, going go pre-Botzinger, also going
send off collaterals places. collaterals obviously influence
emotional state. So, quite different potential sources. None
exclusive. interesting paper, shows block nasal
breathing, still don't see breathing related oscillations brain.
think mechanism occurring breathing related oscillations brain,
playing role signal processing. maybe, talk little bit
role oscillations may playing signal processing?

01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia

- Definitely, do, just want ask intermediate question.
talked lot inhalation, inspiration exhalation. breath holds?
apnea, instance, people holding breath, whether not conscious
unconscious, holding breath. known breath holds terms
might interact brain state oxygen CO2, particularly interested
breath holds lungs empty versus breath holds lungs full might differ
terms impact brain. not aware studies looking
mechanistic level, find really interesting even no studies, love
care speculate. - Well, one breath practices intrigued
basically hyperventilate minute hold breath long can. -
Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots air. - Wim Hof style or, call laboratory,
frankly Tummo, Wim, referred cyclic
hyperventilation. So, basically [panting], right? Followed breath hold
breath hold done lungs full lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, long
talk colleagues might think inline mechanisms are,
particularly breath hold. certainly envisioned component
respect presence absence rhythmicity cortex,
effect. thing hyperventilation, hypoventilation apnea


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone

time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30

here, one things really enjoy conversations

colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't

threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea

conversation Dr. Jack Feldman, last certainly not least, thank
interest science.


CO2 levels going low high. - Anytime holding breath. - Anytime
hold breath, okay? going profound influence. Now,
talk episodic hypoxia lot work going particularly
Gordon Mitchell University Florida extraordinary work
episodic hypoxia. So, '80s, David Millhorn really intriguing work. ask
hold breath, excuse me. gave low oxygen mixture couple
minutes, breathing level go 'cause want oxygen. -
starving air. - [Andrew Jack] Yeah. - No, starving oxygen. -
right. - Okay? couple minutes, go up. can reach steady
state level. Not hypoxic can't reach equilibrium. give room
air again, ventilation quickly relaxes back normal. hand,
gave three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia,
five minutes normoxia, three minutes hypoxia, five minutes normoxia- - Normoxia
normal air. - Normal air. ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. last episode, breathing comes doesn't continue come
down, rises stays hours, okay? well validated now.
originally done animals, humans time, seems profound benefit
motor function cognitive function. - direction? - Positive, positive.
often toyed idea getting 8% oxygen, don't this, listeners, getting 8%
oxygen tank desk writing grant like "Blue Velvet"
going episodic hypoxia improve cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly
use improvement writing grants. - without low
oxygen. mean, breathwork, presumably? - hard lower
oxygen enough. Okay? experimental studies, typically use 8% oxygen.
hard hold breath long enough. another difference here,
happening CO2 levels. hold breath, oxygen levels
dropping, CO2 levels going up. episodic hypoxia,
CO2 levels going stay pretty normal still breathing, just
oxygen levels gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, described before,
oxygen relatively constant CO2 fluctuating depending emotional state
activity things sort, episodic hypoxia, CO2 relatively constant,
varying oxygen level coming system quite bit. - say
relatively, say CO2 relatively constant, not going go direction
going significantly far normal. Whereas holding


breath, going become hypoxic hypercapnic time. -
explain people hypoxic hypercapnic haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic just technical term low levels oxygen, hyper,
hypoxic, low, hyper high. So, hyperoxia hypocapnia, low CO2 hypercapnia,
highest levels CO2. So, you're, episodic hypoxia, anything,

01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI

going become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. play influence
this. One example remember, Gordon will forgive misquoting
this, patient stroke weakness ankle flection.
is, excuse me, ankle extension, extend ankle. so, patient
seat can measure ankle extension, measured
exposed patient episodic hypoxia measured again, strength
ankle extension went way up. so, Gordon looking this, looking
now spinal cord rehab. - imagine sorts neuromuscular performance,
beneficial. - Gordon looking athletic performance. project
haven't able push next level golf. So, find- - golf?
'Cause love golf? - Well, motor performance coordination. So,
not simply running fast can. coordination, concentration, whole
variety things. so, idea get group golfers give
placebo control, don't know whether breathing gas mixture,
just normal air hypoxic gas mixture, although may able figure based
response. controlled circumstances net, measure
length drives, dispersion whatnot, see happens. Look,
find works golfers, forget cognitive function. sell
unbelievable amounts money. - sounds like terrible idea. [Jack laughs] -
way, not serious selling it, but- - know joking. mean, maybe
people know joking that. No, think anything can
improve cognitive neuromuscular performance going interest wide
range pathologic states like injury, TBI, et cetera. mean, one
frequent questions get recovery concussion traumatic brain injury. lot
people think sports, think football, think rugby, think hockey.
look statistics traumatic brain injury, construction workers, car


crashes, bicycle accidents. mean it, sports part tiny, tiny minuscule fraction
total amount traumatic brain injury there. think protocols tested
context golf interesting constraints measures
mentioned,

01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation

exported number things. want just try imagine whether
not kind breathing pattern breathwork, just direct it,
even partially mimics described terms episodic hypoxia. done lot
Tummo, Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. lab studies
humans, find people cyclic hyperventilation,
minute, exhale, hold breath 15 60 seconds, depending can
do, just keep repeating five minutes, seems least
partially mimics state talking afterwards people report
heightened levels alertness, lower levels kind triggering due stressful events.
feel comfortable higher level autonomic arousal, cognitive focus, number
improvements pretty impressive practitioner Wim Hof Tummo
will familiar with. pattern breathing even, can say maps
describing general sense? - Well, expert Gordon
Mitchell. say moves direction, not extreme don't
think can get levels hypoxia clinically. know
pals Breath Collective actually just bought machine buy machine
this. - [Andrew] see. - bought going
self testing see whether not effect anything can measure.
course, concerned

01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers

self-experimentation, applaud curiosity going it. - Hyperbaric
chambers. hear lot nowadays hyperbaric chambers. People buying 'em
using 'em, thoughts hyperbaric chambers relates
the- - Hyper hypo? - Hyperbaric chambers. - Oh, not talkin' altitude? -
[Andrew] No. - don't really much say. mean, oxygen levels


probably go little bit beneficial effect, way outside
area comfort. - 2022 think going year two things keep hearing
lot about, deliberate use high salt intake performance increasing blood
volume, et cetera, hyperbaric chambers seem catching much
way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

01:57:13 Dr. Feldman’s Breathwork Protocols, Post-Lunch



cognitive function. fortunate case. - terrific
segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.
may particular kinds practices can use helpful optimizing
performance sport. not yet. find get tremendous benefit relatively
short periods five maybe 20 minutes box breathing.
simple do. simple app, helps keep timing. - recall
app is? Apnea Trainer? one? - Well, using Calm long
time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30
minutes day, breath patterns stars like Wim Hof
little intimidating newbies. so, like see something simple,
tell friends is, look, just try five 10 minutes. See feel better,
days. don't like it, stop it, doesn't cost anything. invariably, find
helpful. will often interrupt day take five 10 minutes. Like, find


lagging... think pretty good data performance lunch
declines. so, often lunch, didn't today take five
10 minutes just sort breath practice. - lately, breath practice
look like? - just box breathing five 10 minutes. - duration
inhales holds exhales holds set app? right? - Well, five
seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second
hold. - Yeah, sometimes doubles. 10 seconds just get bored.
just, feel like helpful. mean... Now, not thing
respect trying maintain sanity health. - No, can imagine there'd
number things, although, seem sane healthy,
fact, know things.

02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol

- Right, suspect am. - suspect data. Awhile back
conversation, casual conversation, said something really stuck
mind, might specific pattern breathwork one not
important experiencing transitions states based deliberate breathwork
something extent, interpreted mean box breathing
five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold couple
days, maybe even couple minutes switch 10 seconds
switch Tummo, something powerful perhaps transitions
realizing relationship different patterns breathing transitions,
much way can get one cars amusement park
just goes constant rate stops. different learning shift
gears. used drive manual. still can thinking manual transmission,
even automatic transmission, start get sense vehicle
behaves different conditions. thought beautiful seed
potential breathwork practice least awareness, nobody really
formalized, introduce variability within practice
somewhat random order able sense relationship different speeds
depths inhales, exhales holds forth. essentially, like driving
around track, obstacles different rates breaking restarting
things sort, learn drive. think


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different
breathing practices affecting outcomes different pathways.
olfactory pathway, central pathway, vagal pathway,
descending pathway, different practices may change summation
things think things probably involved, just
beginning scratch surface. just hope can get serious neuroscientists
psychologists right experiments get think lot
value human health here. - too, one reasons lab shifted
sorts things humans. delighted continuing
hardcore mechanistic work mice probably work humans already well,
not already. groups, Epel Lab UCF, number of,
starting see papers

02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory

respiration humans little bit, brain imaging. can't help ask
somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations
relates health neuroscience forth that, one


colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients

remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal

going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.

So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated

therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us

Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,

So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate

oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory

important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath

on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.

basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut

transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross

people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues

way ice baths

01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril

saunas seemed right now anyway, prediction can return
point. want ask studies seen exploring
deliberately restricting one's breathing nasal breathing can things like improve
memory. couple papers "Journal Neuroscience," respectable
journal field, one looking olfactory memory. So, kind made sense
can smell things better nose mouth, unless
sort elk something can, presumably sense
smell mouth well. humans generally smell nose. wasn't
terribly surprising, companion study showed hippocampus,
area involved encoding memories one form another active
will memory recall better people learned information nasal
breathing, opposed mouth breathing. make sense mechanistic
perspective? - Well, given major pathway going olfactory system
brain cut not one receptors mouth, degree
respiratory modulation going see throughout forebrain going less
mouth breathing nose breathing. So, certainly plausible. think
lot experiments need done distinguish two nasal
component non nasal component breathing related signals.
tendency sometimes strong effect exclusive, think
going many inputs can effect. Now, whether
parceled, effect part behavior effect part
behavior remains investigated. certainly strong olfactory component.
interest trying follow central component 'cause know strong
central component this. fact, strong central projection olfactory bulb.
So, regardless whether not air flowing nose,
respiratory input olfactory bulb, combines respiratory modulated


signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

signals coming sensory receptors. - Interesting. long poking
around, forgive pun, nose, one nostril versus nostril? know
sounds little crazy imagine, theories yoga traditions
others breathing one nostril somehow activates certain brain centers,
maybe hemispherically one side brain versus right nostril left
nostril breathing might differ terms levels alertness calmness produce.
not aware mechanistic data that, anything worthwhile
right nostril versus left nostril breathing aware of, love know. - Well,
certainly plausible. don't know data demonstrating it, except anecdotal
reports the, know brain highly lateralized speech one
side dominant hand one side. so, notion
huge signal coming olfactory system it, degree lateralized, not
perfectly symmetrical. one side not going evenly sides, can
imagine signal gets distributed way not uniform,
effectiveness response going particular cortex

01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.

either signal still remains signal removed from. - see.
features brain body, blinking, eye movements,
ability encode sounds, features way function move
perceive things coordinated breathing interesting way? - Thank
question. Almost everything. So, have, example, autonomic side,
respiratory sinus arrhythmia. expiration heart slows down.
pupils oscillate respiratory cycle. don't know functional basis
is, oscillate respiratory cycle. - inhale pupils
constrict, presumably 'cause increase heart rate sympathetic tone,
think constriction guessing relax pupil will get,
exhale pupil will get bigger- - think right, always get valance that-
- Yeah, well, counterintuitive people wouldn't think pupils get,
mean, depends. mean, well, can get alert aroused stress
good reasons, peoples get wider, visual field narrows
opposite true. Anyway, guess idea pupils changing size
therefore aperture visual window changing coordination breathing. -


Okay. fear response changes respiratory cycle. - Can tell us
that? - Well, paper Solano, think showed rather clearly
show individuals fearful faces measured response fearfulness changes
inspiration expiration. don't know why, does. reaction time
changes. talk blinking. reaction time changes inspiration
expiration. ask punch something time will change inspiration
expiration. fact, don't know degree martial artists exploit that. watch
breathing pattern opponent will actually move slower one cycle
compared other. - Meaning they're, direction? exhaling,
can punch faster? - say, don't keep table direction things
move 'cause martial arts field now. - vague understanding
exhales strikes typical way that, people strike,
exhale. many- - exhale, components striking
want stiffen rib cage, want make Valsalva maneuver.
inspiration expiration. time. So, don't know enough about,
say expiration, assume make strike,
actually sort wanting stiffen here, Valsalva like maneuver. -
oftentimes clench fist last moment. Anyway, whole set
motor things can talk fighters. know people know fighters,
can ask them. Interesting. things modulated
breathing? - think anything anyone looks seems breathing component
brain, hard imagine not effective. Now,
whether incidental just background doesn't really behavioral
advantage possible. cases, might behavioral advantage. mean,
big, eye-opening thing probably decade ago, digging literature
seeing much cortical activity subcortical activity respiratory modulator
component it. think lot colleagues studying cortex
oblivious this, find, heard talk day person will go un-
named, found lot things correlated particular movement. think all,
looked, said, gee, list things respiratory modulated.
rather correlated movement looking at, think
movement looking modulated breathing, everything else.
So, wasn't movement driving correlation.
correlated something else, breathing movement whether


not behaviorally relevant, behaviorally something can exploit, don't know.
- suspect right, breathing not foundational driver many, not
things least one foundational drivers. - background,
brain, oscillations play important part brain function. vary
frequency maybe 100 hertz to, well, can get circadian sort
monthly cycles, breathing occupies rather unusual place because... So,
let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get
little bit anxious, deep breath, deep breaths tremendously effective
calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities
sort going around circuit. continuous nervous system,
signals keep repeating, tend get stronger can get strong, can't
break them. So, can imagine depression something going
on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,
know circuits get thrown off, nervous system tries adjust way
another, turns least breathing evolutionary reason, just
happenstance, seems improve emotional function,

cognitive function. fortunate case. - terrific
segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.
may particular kinds practices can use helpful optimizing
performance sport. not yet. find get tremendous benefit relatively
short periods five maybe 20 minutes box breathing.
simple do. simple app, helps keep timing. - recall
app is? Apnea Trainer? one? - Well, using Calm long
time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30
minutes day, breath patterns stars like Wim Hof
little intimidating newbies. so, like see something simple,
tell friends is, look, just try five 10 minutes. See feel better,
days. don't like it, stop it, doesn't cost anything. invariably, find
helpful. will often interrupt day take five 10 minutes. Like, find


lagging... think pretty good data performance lunch
declines. so, often lunch, didn't today take five
10 minutes just sort breath practice. - lately, breath practice
look like? - just box breathing five 10 minutes. - duration
inhales holds exhales holds set app? right? - Well, five
seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second
hold. - Yeah, sometimes doubles. 10 seconds just get bored.
just, feel like helpful. mean... Now, not thing
respect trying maintain sanity health. - No, can imagine there'd
number things, although, seem sane healthy,
fact, know things.

02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol

- Right, suspect am. - suspect data. Awhile back
conversation, casual conversation, said something really stuck
mind, might specific pattern breathwork one not
important experiencing transitions states based deliberate breathwork
something extent, interpreted mean box breathing
five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold couple
days, maybe even couple minutes switch 10 seconds
switch Tummo, something powerful perhaps transitions
realizing relationship different patterns breathing transitions,
much way can get one cars amusement park
just goes constant rate stops. different learning shift
gears. used drive manual. still can thinking manual transmission,
even automatic transmission, start get sense vehicle
behaves different conditions. thought beautiful seed
potential breathwork practice least awareness, nobody really
formalized, introduce variability within practice
somewhat random order able sense relationship different speeds
depths inhales, exhales holds forth. essentially, like driving
around track, obstacles different rates breaking restarting
things sort, learn drive. think


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different
breathing practices affecting outcomes different pathways.
olfactory pathway, central pathway, vagal pathway,
descending pathway, different practices may change summation
things think things probably involved, just
beginning scratch surface. just hope can get serious neuroscientists
psychologists right experiments get think lot
value human health here. - too, one reasons lab shifted
sorts things humans. delighted continuing
hardcore mechanistic work mice probably work humans already well,
not already. groups, Epel Lab UCF, number of,
starting see papers

02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory

respiration humans little bit, brain imaging. can't help ask
somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations
relates health neuroscience forth that, one


colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically
compound, sold commercially. So, compound sold
commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

let talk people think oscillation's doing, particularly faster ones.
important coordinating signals across neurons. Just like computer,
computer steps. So, computer knows information coming another part
computer originated particular time. so, screen step-
by-step thing important computer control. Now, brain not digital device,
analog device, signal coming ear eye,
Andrew Huberman speaking looking face, see whole,
signal coming different parts brain. unify that? Well,
neurons sensitive changes signals arriving fractions millisecond.
So, know sure signals coming represent signal. Well,
throughout brain isolation signals ride oscillation, say
peak oscillation, can much better handle road timing
say, "Those two signals came time. may relate
object ah ha, see one unified thing spouting talking." so,
oscillations come many different frequency ranges important memory
formation sorts things. don't think people pay much attention breathing
relatively slow range think milliseconds,
important things thought important cognitive function,
cycles per second 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing humans maybe .2
cycles per second, every five seconds. Although rodents four per second,
pretty fast. So, breathing one thing special, can
readily change it. So, degree brain using slow signal anything,
becomes part normal signal processing, now change it. signal
processing change. signal processing changes, acutely
change. So, asked breath practice, long it? Well,
single breath will change state. nervous, take deep breath
seems help relax, so- - sigh. - Call will, call will. seems
work. Now, doesn't permanent change, getting bat


getting first tee getting give big talk coming podcast, get

calming one down. so, can get transient disruption, hand,
take something like depression. think it's, can envision depression activities

on, can't break it. so, trouble get certain levels
depression, mean, us get depressed point, not continuous,
not long lasting, able break it. long lasting deep, can't
break it. So, question break it? Well, extreme measures
break it. electroconvulsive shock. shock whole brain.
disrupting activity whole brain. circuit starts get back together
again, disruptive. know brain, signals get disrupted little
bit, can weaken connections weakening connections
circuit involved depression, may get relief electroconvulsive shock
work relieving many kinds depression. pretty heroic. Focal deep brain
stimulation thing, localized transcranial stimulation.
disrupting network. getting back together, may weaken
connections. breathing playing role circuit, now, instead
like one second shock, 30 minutes disruption slow breathing
breathing practice, circuits begin break little bit, get relief.
continue circuit can build back again, gradually can
wear circuit down. sort liken this, tell people like walking around dirt
path. build rut, rut gets deep can't get it. breathing
sort filling right rut bit bit point can climb
rut. breathing signal playing role way circuit
works, disrupt that, circuit gets little thrown off kilter,

nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically
compound, sold commercially. So, compound sold
commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.

cognitive function. fortunate case. - terrific
segue want ask next, part set questions want
make sure touch wrap up,
knowledge terms breathing practice? mentioned one breath can shift
brain state can powerful. think absolutely true. also
talked 30 minute breathwork practices, 30 minutes breathwork,
pretty serious commitment think, doable. Certainly zero cost, except
time cases. see landscape breathwork
done like, like it? think you,
like see terms exploration breathwork do? - Well,
relatively new convert breathwork. investigation it, became
convinced real, basically beginner terms practice.
like keep things simple, think discussed before. liken someone
couch potato told got begin exercise. don't go
run marathon. So, couch potato, say, okay, get walk five minutes
10 minutes. then, okay, now walking longer period. begin run,
reach point, say, well, gee, interested sport.
may particular kinds practices can use helpful optimizing
performance sport. not yet. find get tremendous benefit relatively
short periods five maybe 20 minutes box breathing.
simple do. simple app, helps keep timing. - recall
app is? Apnea Trainer? one? - Well, using Calm long
time, let subscription lapse another one whose name don't
remember it's, simple works me. now trying Tummo,
just curious exploring may acting different way
want see respond differently. So, don't particular point view. Now,
friends colleagues particular styles like Wim Hof. think
great getting people interested. think notion
like see people exploring degree, point out, 30
minutes day, breath patterns stars like Wim Hof
little intimidating newbies. so, like see something simple,
tell friends is, look, just try five 10 minutes. See feel better,
days. don't like it, stop it, doesn't cost anything. invariably, find
helpful. will often interrupt day take five 10 minutes. Like, find


lagging... think pretty good data performance lunch
declines. so, often lunch, didn't today take five
10 minutes just sort breath practice. - lately, breath practice
look like? - just box breathing five 10 minutes. - duration
inhales holds exhales holds set app? right? - Well, five
seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second
hold. - Yeah, sometimes doubles. 10 seconds just get bored.
just, feel like helpful. mean... Now, not thing
respect trying maintain sanity health. - No, can imagine there'd
number things, although, seem sane healthy,
fact, know things.

02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol

- Right, suspect am. - suspect data. Awhile back
conversation, casual conversation, said something really stuck
mind, might specific pattern breathwork one not
important experiencing transitions states based deliberate breathwork
something extent, interpreted mean box breathing
five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold couple
days, maybe even couple minutes switch 10 seconds
switch Tummo, something powerful perhaps transitions
realizing relationship different patterns breathing transitions,
much way can get one cars amusement park
just goes constant rate stops. different learning shift
gears. used drive manual. still can thinking manual transmission,
even automatic transmission, start get sense vehicle
behaves different conditions. thought beautiful seed
potential breathwork practice least awareness, nobody really
formalized, introduce variability within practice
somewhat random order able sense relationship different speeds
depths inhales, exhales holds forth. essentially, like driving
around track, obstacles different rates breaking restarting
things sort, learn drive. think


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different

today's podcast, many previous podcast episodes, talk supplements.
supplements aren't necessary everybody, many people derive tremendous
benefit them. One key issues supplements going take
utmost quality. reason, Huberman Lab Podcast
partnered Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. Thorne Supplements highest
quality, respect quality ingredients themselves, precision
amounts ingredients. say that? Well, many supplement companies
list amounts particular substances bottle,
tested, not match actually products. Thorne highest
levels stringency quality particular amounts product.

conversation Dr. Jack Feldman, last certainly not least, thank
interest science.


like enough, can call Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs].
asked BBC interview didn't name Feldman complex, instead
pre-Botzinger complex? - said already Feldman complex. - Well, sounds
like psychiatric disorder, think primary effect disruptive effect,
described, particular responses may clearly vary depending
disruption is. don't know particular data, well controlled
experiments, can actually work different types breathing patterns
simply box pattern, just varying durations. mean, pranayama sort
similar, amount time spend going around box different. So, don't
really much say this. mean, need better controlled
experiments humans think able study rodents
can wide range perturbations invasive studies
really get regions affected, signal processing
disrupted, still hypothesis, disrupted tell us lot
maybe resonant point optimal effect take
particular breathing practice. talked fact different
breathing practices affecting outcomes different pathways.
olfactory pathway, central pathway, vagal pathway,
descending pathway, different practices may change summation
things think things probably involved, just
beginning scratch surface. just hope can get serious neuroscientists
psychologists right experiments get think lot
value human health here. - too, one reasons lab shifted
sorts things humans. delighted continuing
hardcore mechanistic work mice probably work humans already well,
not already. groups, Epel Lab UCF, number of,
starting see papers

02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory

respiration humans little bit, brain imaging. can't help ask
somewhat unrelated topic, important light conversation
here, one things really enjoy conversations
relates health neuroscience forth that, one


colleagues openly admits exploring supplementation. long time
supplement fan. think power compounds, prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized. don't use haphazardly, think certainly power
them. one places converge terms interest
nervous system supplementation vis-a-vis magnesium. Now, talked endlessly
podcast elsewhere magnesium sake sleep, improving transit
transitions sleep forth. somewhat different interest
magnesium relates cognitive function durability cognitive function.
mind just sharing us little bit interest is, stems from,
Huberman Podcast, often talk supplementation,
information. - So, need disclose scientific advisor
company called Neurocentria, graduate student, Guosong Liu CEO.
said, can give background. Guosong, although lab
worked breathing, deep interest learning memory. left
lab, went work renowned learning memory guy Stanford, Dick Chen.
finished there, hired Susumu Tonegawa MIT. - also
knows thing two memory. teasing. Susumu Tonegawa Nobel
work immunoglobulins, world-class memory researcher. - Yeah,
more. - many things. - Guosong curious, bright guy,
interested signals neurons get strengthened, called long-term
potentiation LTP. one questions arose inputs neuron
get LTP, LTP bigger signal bigger noise less? So, can
imagine listening something, louder, can hear better.
less noise, can hear better. wanted investigate this.
tissue culture hippocampal neurons, found lowered
background activity neurons, LTP elicited got stronger,
way increasing level magnesium bathing solution. gets
esoteric electrophysiology, basically background level noise
neurons, part regulated degree magnesium
extracellular bath. - mean electrical noise. - Electrical noise, sorry, electrical
noise. you, called physiological range, 0.8 1.2
millimolar, don't worry number. - can't believe remember
millimolar magnesium. - Well, always frightened get, say micro femto
something, go off several orders magnitude, physiological range,


big difference amount noise neuron 0.8 1.2
millimolar. So, played around magnesium, found
magnesium elevated, LTP. right, observation tissue
culture. - Right, just mention LTP essentially translates
neuro-plasticity, rewiring connections essence. - So, tested mice
basically, offered a, control mice, got normal diet one
had, one enriched magnesium, ones lived enriched magnesium
higher cognitive function, lived longer, everything want magic pill,
mice that. Excuse me, rats. problem couldn't imagine taking
humans magnesium salts don't passively get gut
bloodstream, brain. pass via called transporter. Transporter
something membrane grabs magnesium molecule atom, pulls
side. imagining magnesium gut,
transporters pull magnesium gut bloodstream. Well, take
normal magnesium supplement can buy pharmacy, doesn't cross
gut easily. take enough get bloodstream, start
getting diarrhea. not good way go. - Well, good way go. couldn't
help myself. - [laughs] Well said. So, worked brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,
Fay looked whole range magnesium compounds found magnesium
threonate much effective crossing gut blood barrier. Now, didn't
realize time, threonate metabolite vitamin C, lots
threonate body. magnesium threonate appear safe maybe
part role now believe part role threonate
supercharges transporter get magnesium in. remember, need
transporter gut brain cells. So, gave magnesium threonate
mice had, no, let backtrack bit. study humans. hired
company test hands-off test. one companies gets
hired big pharma test them, got patients
diagnosed mild cognitive decline. people cognitive disorder,
age inappropriate. metric use determining far off
Spearman's G factor, generalized measure intelligence
psychologists except, biological age subjects was, think 51
cognitive age 61 based Spearman's G's test. Oh, say Spearman
G factor starts particular level population age 20 declines 1%


year. So, sorry say, not 20 year olds anymore, get number
that, can put curve see whether age not. people
10 years older according metric long story short three
months placebo controlled double blind study. people
placebo arm improved two years, common human studies 'cause placebo
effect. people got compound improved eight years average,
improved eight years. didn't diagnosis caused
molecule decline pretty, extraordinarily impressive. - So, moved
cognition closer biological age? - Biological age. Biological age. -
recall doses magnesium threonate- - paper basically
compound, sold commercially. So, compound sold
commercially handled nutraceutical wholesaler sells retailers
make whatever formulation want. dosage is, understanding
rarely tolerable. take half dose. reason take half dose blood
magnesium measured, low normal age. took half dose, became
high normal, felt comfortable staying normal range, lot people
taking full dose age, not looking get smarter, looking decline
slowly. hard tell whether not effective not. - Well,
remembered millimolar magnesium solution high
low end, say not well controlled study N one, seems
working. - recommended friends, academics not
nature skeptical, not cynical, insist try it, usually don't report
major change cognitive function, although sometimes report, "Well, feel
little bit alert my, physical movements better," many
report sleep better. - makes sense. think good evidence
threonate can accelerate transition sleep maybe even access deeper
modes sleep people. many people actually, small percentage
people take threonate including one podcast staff stomach issues
it. can't tolerate it. So, say just anecdotally, 5% people don't
tolerate threonate well. Stop taking fine. caused diarrhea
something sort, people tolerate well people report
vastly improves sleep. again, anecdotally. studies
way, interesting I,
discussion threonate, wasn't aware cognitive enhancing effects,


story makes sense mechanistic perspective.
