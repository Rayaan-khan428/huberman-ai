00:07:00 Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity

go headspace.com/specialoffer. now discussion Dr. Anna Lembke.
right, great here. - Thank me, excited here. - Yeah,
lot questions you. I, many listeners podcast, obsessed
dopamine, dopamine, work? hear dopamine
molecule associated pleasure. think term dopamine hits, like getting
dopamine hit this, Instagram, likes praise whatever,
now commonly heard. dopamine, maybe things
dopamine people don't know? probably don't know either. -
dopamine neurotransmitter, neurotransmitters molecules bridge
gap two neurons. essentially allow one neuron, pre-synaptic
neuron, communicate post-synaptic neuron. Dopamine intimately
associated experience reward, also movement, think really
interesting, movement reward linked, right? think about,
know, early humans, move order go seek water meat
whatever was. even primitive organisms, dopamine released
food sensed environment. example, C elegans, primitive worm.
dopamine really powerful, important molecule brain helps us
experience pleasure. not neurotransmitter involved pleasure,
really, really important one. want think something people
don't know dopamine, think really interesting, always
releasing dopamine kind tonic baseline rate. really deviation
baseline, rather like hits dopamine vacuum, make difference.
experience pleasure, dopamine release goes baseline, likewise
dopamine can go tonic baseline, experience kind pain. -
Interesting. fair say one's baseline levels dopamine, frequently
releasing dopamine, absence some, don't know, drug food
experience, just sitting, being, associated happy somebody is, kind
baseline happiness level depression? - evidence shows


people depressed may indeed lower tonic levels dopamine.
really reasonable thought, evidence suggest may true.
thing know, really kind book about,
expose chronically substances behaviors repeatedly release
large amounts dopamine brains reward pathway, can change tonic
baseline actually lower time, brain tries compensate
dopamine, really designed experience. - Interesting
is, case baseline levels dopamine set genetics,
heredity? - Well think, know, think sort of, know, early stages
development infancy, certainly true. kind of, know, born
probably whatever baseline level. obviously experiences can
huge impact dopamine level ultimately settles out. - somebody's
disposition one constant excitement anticipation, easily excited, think
kind people say hey, want check new place tacos,
like "Yeah, that'd great!" people little cynical, harder
budge. Like bulldog Costello. Very, stable, low levels dopamine big
inflections case. think set terms parents, obviously
nature nurture interact, that, dopamine core temperament? -
don't really think know answer that, will say people definitely born
different temperaments, temperaments affect ability
experience joy. And, know, known long time, describe
many different ways. One ways describe modern era use
psychiatric nomenclature. Like person dysthymic temperament, or, know,
person chronic major depressive disorder. terms looking specifically
vulnerable addiction, interesting sort mixed bag
look research risk factors addiction, kind temperament
person makes vulnerable addiction, see interesting findings.
First see people impulsive vulnerable addiction.
impulsivity? means difficulty putting space thought
desire something, actually it. people difficulty putting
space there, thought something just impulsively, people
vulnerable addiction. - Interesting. I, terms impulsivity,
something relates literally startle reflex? Like I, instance, lab director,
familiar walking around lab decide, deciding going talk


people, course knock door always like wait,
bothered right now? Even though love talk them. walk around lab
time time, people notice, say, moment, slowly
turn around say, yeah, no, cases. people will jump moment
say name. actually a, kind heightened startle reflex.
related impulsivity, referring attempt withhold behavior
deliberate, deliberate conditions? - Yeah, don't think startle
reflex necessarily related impulsivity. can related anxiety. people
high anxiety people will tend startle reflex. Impulsivity little bit
different. way, impulsivity not always bad, right. Impulsivity thing
not lot self-editing worrying future consequences. know,
idea something it. course can imagine many
scenarios absolutely wonderful. know, can sort of, say
intimate interactions people, wouldn't really want super
inhibited it, right. want disinhibited impulsive. can also like
imagine like sort fight flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right,
really good impulsive just go rhino! - hesitation can cost
life? - Right, yes, right, right. But, know, think brings
really, something come believe 25 years practicing psychiatry,
now conceptualize current ecosystem mental illness, actually traits
another ecosystem might advantageous. just not advantageous
right now, world live in. think, know, impulsivity
potentially one those, right? 'Cause live world sort like,
constantly thinking sort rationally consequences X, Y, Z.
sensory rich environment, right, bombarded
opportunities, sensory opportunities. constantly check ourselves.
impulsivity something right now can difficult trait, isn't
bad thing. - see. it's, beginning realize fine line

00:15:56 Pleasure?

spontaneity impulsivity. - Yeah. - pleasure work,
biological level, feels right, psychological level? don't mind
painting picture sort range things observed clinic,


life, people can become addicted to. just start off really simply,
thing call pleasure? - Well, think actually really hard define pleasure
kind succinct way, certainly seeking high,
euphoria, think, know, kind experience almost anybody
associate word pleasure. also seeking substances
behaviors often way escape pain. example, talk people
addiction, sometimes initial foray using drug get pleasure, often
way escape suffering, whatever suffering may be. certainly
people become addicted, even initially seeking pleasure
ultimately just trying avoid pain withdrawal pain consequences
drug use. think it's, know, hard actually, know, define
unitary thing. certainly not just getting high. many ways
people sort want escape, not thing sort hedonic,
know, wanting feel pleasure. - someone decide want go
dance, get dance, pleasure dancing. can imagine that. But,
maybe difficult stay seated particular song comes on,
instance. seeking call pleasure order eliminate pain, evokes
different picture mind. evokes picture somebody feels lost
depressed underwhelmed.

00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion Life

definitely want get precise general description addiction
is, previous conversation had, said something really rung
mind, many people become addicted things, call addicts,
feeling normal life isn't interesting enough. seeking super
normal experience, day-to-day routine balance, actually title
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence",
word balance can sometimes bit adversive term people.
struck idea, reason want explore much see
online generating lack balance, tilted forward times, really
leaning life hard, experiencing life, know, living full life. Even
commencement speech given Steve Jobs campus really finding
passion, digging. know, much narrative now. maybe


just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict

no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier

Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links

understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure

that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction

ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now

happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

00:07:00 Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity

go headspace.com/specialoffer. now discussion Dr. Anna Lembke.
right, great here. - Thank me, excited here. - Yeah,
lot questions you. I, many listeners podcast, obsessed
dopamine, dopamine, work? hear dopamine
molecule associated pleasure. think term dopamine hits, like getting
dopamine hit this, Instagram, likes praise whatever,
now commonly heard. dopamine, maybe things
dopamine people don't know? probably don't know either. -
dopamine neurotransmitter, neurotransmitters molecules bridge
gap two neurons. essentially allow one neuron, pre-synaptic
neuron, communicate post-synaptic neuron. Dopamine intimately
associated experience reward, also movement, think really
interesting, movement reward linked, right? think about,
know, early humans, move order go seek water meat
whatever was. even primitive organisms, dopamine released
food sensed environment. example, C elegans, primitive worm.
dopamine really powerful, important molecule brain helps us
experience pleasure. not neurotransmitter involved pleasure,
really, really important one. want think something people
don't know dopamine, think really interesting, always
releasing dopamine kind tonic baseline rate. really deviation
baseline, rather like hits dopamine vacuum, make difference.
experience pleasure, dopamine release goes baseline, likewise
dopamine can go tonic baseline, experience kind pain. -
Interesting. fair say one's baseline levels dopamine, frequently
releasing dopamine, absence some, don't know, drug food
experience, just sitting, being, associated happy somebody is, kind
baseline happiness level depression? - evidence shows


people depressed may indeed lower tonic levels dopamine.
really reasonable thought, evidence suggest may true.
thing know, really kind book about,
expose chronically substances behaviors repeatedly release
large amounts dopamine brains reward pathway, can change tonic
baseline actually lower time, brain tries compensate
dopamine, really designed experience. - Interesting
is, case baseline levels dopamine set genetics,
heredity? - Well think, know, think sort of, know, early stages
development infancy, certainly true. kind of, know, born
probably whatever baseline level. obviously experiences can
huge impact dopamine level ultimately settles out. - somebody's
disposition one constant excitement anticipation, easily excited, think
kind people say hey, want check new place tacos,
like "Yeah, that'd great!" people little cynical, harder
budge. Like bulldog Costello. Very, stable, low levels dopamine big
inflections case. think set terms parents, obviously
nature nurture interact, that, dopamine core temperament? -
don't really think know answer that, will say people definitely born
different temperaments, temperaments affect ability
experience joy. And, know, known long time, describe
many different ways. One ways describe modern era use
psychiatric nomenclature. Like person dysthymic temperament, or, know,
person chronic major depressive disorder. terms looking specifically
vulnerable addiction, interesting sort mixed bag
look research risk factors addiction, kind temperament
person makes vulnerable addiction, see interesting findings.
First see people impulsive vulnerable addiction.
impulsivity? means difficulty putting space thought
desire something, actually it. people difficulty putting
space there, thought something just impulsively, people
vulnerable addiction. - Interesting. I, terms impulsivity,
something relates literally startle reflex? Like I, instance, lab director,
familiar walking around lab decide, deciding going talk


people, course knock door always like wait,
bothered right now? Even though love talk them. walk around lab
time time, people notice, say, moment, slowly
turn around say, yeah, no, cases. people will jump moment
say name. actually a, kind heightened startle reflex.
related impulsivity, referring attempt withhold behavior
deliberate, deliberate conditions? - Yeah, don't think startle
reflex necessarily related impulsivity. can related anxiety. people
high anxiety people will tend startle reflex. Impulsivity little bit
different. way, impulsivity not always bad, right. Impulsivity thing
not lot self-editing worrying future consequences. know,
idea something it. course can imagine many
scenarios absolutely wonderful. know, can sort of, say
intimate interactions people, wouldn't really want super
inhibited it, right. want disinhibited impulsive. can also like
imagine like sort fight flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right,
really good impulsive just go rhino! - hesitation can cost
life? - Right, yes, right, right. But, know, think brings
really, something come believe 25 years practicing psychiatry,
now conceptualize current ecosystem mental illness, actually traits
another ecosystem might advantageous. just not advantageous
right now, world live in. think, know, impulsivity
potentially one those, right? 'Cause live world sort like,
constantly thinking sort rationally consequences X, Y, Z.
sensory rich environment, right, bombarded
opportunities, sensory opportunities. constantly check ourselves.
impulsivity something right now can difficult trait, isn't
bad thing. - see. it's, beginning realize fine line

00:15:56 Pleasure?

spontaneity impulsivity. - Yeah. - pleasure work,
biological level, feels right, psychological level? don't mind
painting picture sort range things observed clinic,


life, people can become addicted to. just start off really simply,
thing call pleasure? - Well, think actually really hard define pleasure
kind succinct way, certainly seeking high,
euphoria, think, know, kind experience almost anybody
associate word pleasure. also seeking substances
behaviors often way escape pain. example, talk people
addiction, sometimes initial foray using drug get pleasure, often
way escape suffering, whatever suffering may be. certainly
people become addicted, even initially seeking pleasure
ultimately just trying avoid pain withdrawal pain consequences
drug use. think it's, know, hard actually, know, define
unitary thing. certainly not just getting high. many ways
people sort want escape, not thing sort hedonic,
know, wanting feel pleasure. - someone decide want go
dance, get dance, pleasure dancing. can imagine that. But,
maybe difficult stay seated particular song comes on,
instance. seeking call pleasure order eliminate pain, evokes
different picture mind. evokes picture somebody feels lost
depressed underwhelmed.

00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion Life

definitely want get precise general description addiction
is, previous conversation had, said something really rung
mind, many people become addicted things, call addicts,
feeling normal life isn't interesting enough. seeking super
normal experience, day-to-day routine balance, actually title
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence",
word balance can sometimes bit adversive term people.
struck idea, reason want explore much see
online generating lack balance, tilted forward times, really
leaning life hard, experiencing life, know, living full life. Even
commencement speech given Steve Jobs campus really finding
passion, digging. know, much narrative now. maybe


just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take

people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh

don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

people depressed may indeed lower tonic levels dopamine.
really reasonable thought, evidence suggest may true.
thing know, really kind book about,
expose chronically substances behaviors repeatedly release
large amounts dopamine brains reward pathway, can change tonic
baseline actually lower time, brain tries compensate
dopamine, really designed experience. - Interesting
is, case baseline levels dopamine set genetics,
heredity? - Well think, know, think sort of, know, early stages
development infancy, certainly true. kind of, know, born
probably whatever baseline level. obviously experiences can
huge impact dopamine level ultimately settles out. - somebody's
disposition one constant excitement anticipation, easily excited, think
kind people say hey, want check new place tacos,
like "Yeah, that'd great!" people little cynical, harder
budge. Like bulldog Costello. Very, stable, low levels dopamine big
inflections case. think set terms parents, obviously
nature nurture interact, that, dopamine core temperament? -
don't really think know answer that, will say people definitely born
different temperaments, temperaments affect ability
experience joy. And, know, known long time, describe
many different ways. One ways describe modern era use
psychiatric nomenclature. Like person dysthymic temperament, or, know,
person chronic major depressive disorder. terms looking specifically
vulnerable addiction, interesting sort mixed bag
look research risk factors addiction, kind temperament
person makes vulnerable addiction, see interesting findings.
First see people impulsive vulnerable addiction.
impulsivity? means difficulty putting space thought
desire something, actually it. people difficulty putting
space there, thought something just impulsively, people
vulnerable addiction. - Interesting. I, terms impulsivity,
something relates literally startle reflex? Like I, instance, lab director,
familiar walking around lab decide, deciding going talk


people, course knock door always like wait,
bothered right now? Even though love talk them. walk around lab
time time, people notice, say, moment, slowly
turn around say, yeah, no, cases. people will jump moment
say name. actually a, kind heightened startle reflex.
related impulsivity, referring attempt withhold behavior
deliberate, deliberate conditions? - Yeah, don't think startle
reflex necessarily related impulsivity. can related anxiety. people
high anxiety people will tend startle reflex. Impulsivity little bit
different. way, impulsivity not always bad, right. Impulsivity thing
not lot self-editing worrying future consequences. know,
idea something it. course can imagine many
scenarios absolutely wonderful. know, can sort of, say
intimate interactions people, wouldn't really want super
inhibited it, right. want disinhibited impulsive. can also like
imagine like sort fight flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right,
really good impulsive just go rhino! - hesitation can cost
life? - Right, yes, right, right. But, know, think brings
really, something come believe 25 years practicing psychiatry,
now conceptualize current ecosystem mental illness, actually traits
another ecosystem might advantageous. just not advantageous
right now, world live in. think, know, impulsivity
potentially one those, right? 'Cause live world sort like,
constantly thinking sort rationally consequences X, Y, Z.
sensory rich environment, right, bombarded
opportunities, sensory opportunities. constantly check ourselves.
impulsivity something right now can difficult trait, isn't
bad thing. - see. it's, beginning realize fine line

00:15:56 Pleasure?

spontaneity impulsivity. - Yeah. - pleasure work,
biological level, feels right, psychological level? don't mind
painting picture sort range things observed clinic,


life, people can become addicted to. just start off really simply,
thing call pleasure? - Well, think actually really hard define pleasure
kind succinct way, certainly seeking high,
euphoria, think, know, kind experience almost anybody
associate word pleasure. also seeking substances
behaviors often way escape pain. example, talk people
addiction, sometimes initial foray using drug get pleasure, often
way escape suffering, whatever suffering may be. certainly
people become addicted, even initially seeking pleasure
ultimately just trying avoid pain withdrawal pain consequences
drug use. think it's, know, hard actually, know, define
unitary thing. certainly not just getting high. many ways
people sort want escape, not thing sort hedonic,
know, wanting feel pleasure. - someone decide want go
dance, get dance, pleasure dancing. can imagine that. But,
maybe difficult stay seated particular song comes on,
instance. seeking call pleasure order eliminate pain, evokes
different picture mind. evokes picture somebody feels lost
depressed underwhelmed.

00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion Life

definitely want get precise general description addiction
is, previous conversation had, said something really rung
mind, many people become addicted things, call addicts,
feeling normal life isn't interesting enough. seeking super
normal experience, day-to-day routine balance, actually title
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence",
word balance can sometimes bit adversive term people.
struck idea, reason want explore much see
online generating lack balance, tilted forward times, really
leaning life hard, experiencing life, know, living full life. Even
commencement speech given Steve Jobs campus really finding
passion, digging. know, much narrative now. maybe


just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not

need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters

also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

people, course knock door always like wait,
bothered right now? Even though love talk them. walk around lab
time time, people notice, say, moment, slowly
turn around say, yeah, no, cases. people will jump moment
say name. actually a, kind heightened startle reflex.
related impulsivity, referring attempt withhold behavior
deliberate, deliberate conditions? - Yeah, don't think startle
reflex necessarily related impulsivity. can related anxiety. people
high anxiety people will tend startle reflex. Impulsivity little bit
different. way, impulsivity not always bad, right. Impulsivity thing
not lot self-editing worrying future consequences. know,
idea something it. course can imagine many
scenarios absolutely wonderful. know, can sort of, say
intimate interactions people, wouldn't really want super
inhibited it, right. want disinhibited impulsive. can also like
imagine like sort fight flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right,
really good impulsive just go rhino! - hesitation can cost
life? - Right, yes, right, right. But, know, think brings
really, something come believe 25 years practicing psychiatry,
now conceptualize current ecosystem mental illness, actually traits
another ecosystem might advantageous. just not advantageous
right now, world live in. think, know, impulsivity
potentially one those, right? 'Cause live world sort like,
constantly thinking sort rationally consequences X, Y, Z.
sensory rich environment, right, bombarded
opportunities, sensory opportunities. constantly check ourselves.
impulsivity something right now can difficult trait, isn't
bad thing. - see. it's, beginning realize fine line

00:15:56 Pleasure?

spontaneity impulsivity. - Yeah. - pleasure work,
biological level, feels right, psychological level? don't mind
painting picture sort range things observed clinic,


life, people can become addicted to. just start off really simply,
thing call pleasure? - Well, think actually really hard define pleasure
kind succinct way, certainly seeking high,
euphoria, think, know, kind experience almost anybody
associate word pleasure. also seeking substances
behaviors often way escape pain. example, talk people
addiction, sometimes initial foray using drug get pleasure, often
way escape suffering, whatever suffering may be. certainly
people become addicted, even initially seeking pleasure
ultimately just trying avoid pain withdrawal pain consequences
drug use. think it's, know, hard actually, know, define
unitary thing. certainly not just getting high. many ways
people sort want escape, not thing sort hedonic,
know, wanting feel pleasure. - someone decide want go
dance, get dance, pleasure dancing. can imagine that. But,
maybe difficult stay seated particular song comes on,
instance. seeking call pleasure order eliminate pain, evokes
different picture mind. evokes picture somebody feels lost
depressed underwhelmed.

00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion Life

definitely want get precise general description addiction
is, previous conversation had, said something really rung
mind, many people become addicted things, call addicts,
feeling normal life isn't interesting enough. seeking super
normal experience, day-to-day routine balance, actually title
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence",
word balance can sometimes bit adversive term people.
struck idea, reason want explore much see
online generating lack balance, tilted forward times, really
leaning life hard, experiencing life, know, living full life. Even
commencement speech given Steve Jobs campus really finding
passion, digging. know, much narrative now. maybe


just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

life, people can become addicted to. just start off really simply,
thing call pleasure? - Well, think actually really hard define pleasure
kind succinct way, certainly seeking high,
euphoria, think, know, kind experience almost anybody
associate word pleasure. also seeking substances
behaviors often way escape pain. example, talk people
addiction, sometimes initial foray using drug get pleasure, often
way escape suffering, whatever suffering may be. certainly
people become addicted, even initially seeking pleasure
ultimately just trying avoid pain withdrawal pain consequences
drug use. think it's, know, hard actually, know, define
unitary thing. certainly not just getting high. many ways
people sort want escape, not thing sort hedonic,
know, wanting feel pleasure. - someone decide want go
dance, get dance, pleasure dancing. can imagine that. But,
maybe difficult stay seated particular song comes on,
instance. seeking call pleasure order eliminate pain, evokes
different picture mind. evokes picture somebody feels lost
depressed underwhelmed.

00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion Life

definitely want get precise general description addiction
is, previous conversation had, said something really rung
mind, many people become addicted things, call addicts,
feeling normal life isn't interesting enough. seeking super
normal experience, day-to-day routine balance, actually title
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence",
word balance can sometimes bit adversive term people.
struck idea, reason want explore much see
online generating lack balance, tilted forward times, really
leaning life hard, experiencing life, know, living full life. Even
commencement speech given Steve Jobs campus really finding
passion, digging. know, much narrative now. maybe


just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one

suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug

addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind

looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

just tell us little bit experience association, really exists,
people's sense normalcy, maybe even boring life can be,
tendency become addicts sort. - Yeah, well, mean, think life
humans always hard, think now harder unprecedented ways.
think way life really hard now actually really boring.
reason boring survival needs met, right? mean,
don't even leave homes meet every single physical need, know,
long certain level financial wellbeing, frankly, know, talk
much about, know, income gap, certainly enormous gap
rich poor. gap smaller ever like history
humans. Even poorest poor excess income spend leisure
goods, ever human history. look leisure time,
example, people without high school education 42% leisure time
people college degree. point life hard now really weird
way, don't really anything do. forced make
stuff up, know, whether scientist doctor, Olympic
athlete, or, know, climbing Mount Everest. people really vary need
friction. people need lot others. don't it,
really, really unhappy. think lot people see addiction
forms mental illness people need friction. Like unhappy,
not necessarily something wrong brain,
brain not suited world. - think sense, brain isn't
suited world, simply feel restlessness constantly seeking
stimulation? - think right, yeah. think not really knowing wrong
me, unhappy, can happier? course, talk about,
pervasive narrative now like find passion, know, find your,
know, whatever is, save world. way good
people world seeking. way can also misleading
sense think people aren't entirely aware world hard place, life
hard, that, know, like kind making up. know
mean? - Yeah. Well book Cal Newport, don't know know Cal
Newport's work, guys symbiotic messages. professor
computer science Georgetown. Yes, Georgetown. wrote book years
ago, really ahead time, called "So Good Can't Ignore You", not


meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going

want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring

right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

meditating much work try figure one's passion thinking,
rather go acquire skills, - Right. - develop sense passion something
experience hard work getting better end feedback. - Right. - little bit
growth mindset, think colleague Carol Dweck. gone write books,
"Deep Work", removing technology deep
work. - Yes, right. - big proponent evils context switching
often throughout day. - [Anna] Yeah. - sake productivity, mostly. new book
called "A World Without Email." beginning realize, cite off books
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance Age Indulgence", maybe
reason two don't know one another neither
social media. - it. - Right. - it. - yet two productive
people know, including productive authors.

00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

discussion unto itself. find fascinating. talk
pleasure pain balance addiction. heard use seesaw balance
scale, - Right. - analogy before. think wonderful one really, me,
clarified addiction is, least mechanistic level. - Yeah, me, one
significant findings neuroscience last 75 years pleasure pain
co-located, means parts brain process pleasure also
process pain. work like balance. feel pleasure, balance tips
one way, feel pain, tips opposite direction. one overriding
rules governing balance wants stay level. doesn't want remain
tipped long pleasure pain. deviation neutrality, brain
will work hard restore level balance, scientists call homeostasis.
way brain stimulus one side, will tip equal
opposite amount side. - like principle laws physics. - Yes,
right, right. like, like watch YouTube videos. watch YouTube videos
"American Idol", know, tips side pleasure. stop watching
it, comedown, right, tip equal opposite amount
side. moment wanting watch one YouTube video, right. - Yeah,
just want interject there. moment wanting watch another,
associated pain, think, is, always aware happening?


just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,

say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going

want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better

work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction

ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now

happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened

circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

just described conscious way. - Right. - indulge something
enjoy, usually thinking just wanting - Yes, yes. - thing. don't think
pain, - Yes. - just think more. - Right. really excellent point
mostly not aware it. also reflexive. not something consciously
happens, aware of, unless really begin pay attention.
begin pay attention, really can become aware moment. Again,
like falling away. social media and, know, get good tweet
something, can't stop awareness, latent
awareness, soon disengage behavior, going experience
kind pain, right. falling away, missing feeling, wanting it.
course, one way combat more, right, more, more, more.
think really want people tune get awareness around.
tune it, can see lot. begin see it,
an, keep model balance mind, think gives people kind
way imagine experiencing neuro-biological level, understand
it. understanding, get mastery it, really
about. ultimately need disengage, right? can't live space
time, right. things need do. also serious
consequences come trying repeat continue experience
feeling. - Yeah, understand correctly, find something,
something finds us, enjoy, feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex,
gambling, whatever happens be, will explore full range these,
dopamine release engage behavior. telling
quickly, - [Anna] Yes. - beneath conscious awareness,
tilting back scale pleasure reduced, way increasing pain. - Right. -
heard say pain mechanism competitive
advantages pleasure mechanisms, doesn't just bring scale back
level. actually brings pain higher pleasure. tell us little bit
that? - Yeah, yeah. happens, again, hallmark addictive
substance behavior releases lot dopamine brains reward pathway.
Like, right, like broccoli just doesn't release lot dopamine, just doesn't, right. -
trying imagine, say, maybe you, stopped because.
Broccoli's good, can really good, broccoli never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's
never amazing. - never like, - mean- - amazing broccoli. -


Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one

rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

Honestly can probably find somebody planet broccoli amazing.
course starving, broccoli amazing. - Rich Roll. Rich Roll big plants,
good relationship plants.

00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia

Rich, tell us make broccoli amazing. anyone it'd Rich. - Yeah,
yeah. happens right something really pleasurable releases
lot dopamine, again, brain going immediately compensate down-
regulating dopamine receptors, dopamine transmission, compensate
that, okay. come down, hangover, after-effect, moment
wanting more. Now, just wait feeling pass, dopamine will
re-regulate go back whatever chronic baseline is. don't wait,
really key, keep indulging again, ultimately
much pain side, right, essentially reset brain call like
anhedonic, lacking joy type state, dopamine-deficit state.
really way pain can become main driver, indulged
much high reward behaviors substances, brain
compensate way down-regulating dopamine, even not
drug, dopamine deficit state, akin clinical depression.
anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria. lot mental preoccupation
using again, getting drug. piece there, single use,
easily passes, chronic use can reset really dopamine
thresholds, nothing enjoyable, right?

00:30:47 Addictions Same?

everything sort pales comparison one drug want keep doing. -
one drug person, right? mean, - Yes. - know people life
still talking one relationship, one person just great,
despite challenges thing. almost like addicted narrative. -
Yeah. - maybe, still are, addicted person.
number things, video games, sex, gambling, person, narrative. me,
way describe mechanism, pleasure pain balance,


speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

speaks kind generalizability brain circuitry. something
fascinates me, know fascinates well, nature not evolve
20 different mechanisms 20 different types addiction. Just like anxiety couple
core sets hormones neurotransmitters pathways, one person
triggered social interactions, another person triggered spiders.
underlying response identical. sounds like addiction well, may
nuance, sort core set processes. doesn't really matter
gambling video games sex narrative previous lover partner,
whatever. addictive process underneath that. correct? - Yes, exactly.
whole idea cross-addiction comes in.
addicted substance, severely addicted, makes vulnerable addiction
substance. - say substance, same, just said
also true behaviors? - Yes, so, use word drug talking
substances behaviors really. talking behaviors like gambling, sex,
know, - Porn. - gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping. - Work. - Work. - accused
me, just, record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me,
diagnosed outside clinic, playful way, work-addicted.
probably right. first thoughts wake typically work.
Certainly within 50 milliseconds waking. probably last thoughts have,
hope not work, yeah, work constantly. things,
actively turn off. - Yes. exactly right. certainly not alone that.
course- - Stanford, no, no no no. - Silicon Valley, right,
highly rewarded, right. kind addiction. - embedded culture. - Oh
yeah, absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. city, think called
New York, also work lot hear, heavily rewarded. said,
sure not first person say it, thinking addiction,
thinking underlying circuits posted something social media
said addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure.
way kind crystallized literature mind. met
course came gave amazing lectures neuroanatomy course
medical students, rest history. tossed kind mirroring
statement well, bit overstepping, admit, said, addiction
progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. said, dare say,
enlightenment progressive expansion things bring pleasure. Not


anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

anybody knows enlightenment is, attempt take little bit jab
fact nobody knows. not, wouldn't throw neurobiological
explanation? Just kind sample waters. people varying levels
response would've, reason bring imagine able
derive pleasure many things wonderful attribute. know people
like this, can experience pleasure little things big events. Not just,
know, big milestones life, also subtle, know, the, like yogis
say, subtle ripples life. ability exists, think reflects
healthily tuned dopamine system? One can engage enjoy,
disengage. seeking? underscore, know nothing
enlightenment meditation, it. just, use opportunities explore. -
Yeah, great question understand question as,
striving for, right?

00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead Creativity

settle out? And, know, book, really hold people
recovery severe addiction sort modern day prophets rest us,
think people addicted get recovery,
hard won wisdom can benefit from. wisdom, guess,
know, distill down, mean many things. terms of, know, dopamine,
wisdom adaptive ways get dopamine. less
adaptive ways. general, describe adaptive ways not potent.
not tipping balance hard fast side pleasure. -
mean never allowing absolutely complete bliss? mean not
allowing stay state long? - latter. think latter.
gets temperament, going get second. So, general, want
kind flexibility balance, ability easily reassert homeostasis.
don't want break balance, possible overindulge enough
period time end balance tipped side pain, dopamine deficit
state talking about. want flexible, resilient balance, right, can
sensitive things going environment, can experience pleasure
approach, can experience pain recoil, right? adaptive healthy
necessary good. never want balance doesn't tilt. - Right. -


disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -

recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone

like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

disaster, wouldn't human. wouldn't want that, it'd really,
really boring. hand, people recovery addiction talk is,
extent learn live things little boring lot time, right?
trying avoid intensity thrill-seeking escapism, really
core addictive tendencies. - Sorry interrupt, say boring, can
add stressful boring? - Yes. - days not, one
people remind fun, - Yes. - sort forgot
term means, like think experience lot pleasure little
things, pretty hard-driving guy. like goals big milestones stuff.
Anyway. point many days not bored thinking oh, nothing do,
kind overwhelmed number things really not pleasureful
do. - Yeah, right. - won't mention are, 'cause don't colleagues
like don't respond emails. No, just email. Not Anna,
theirs. event, anxiety boredom can hang together, right?
correct in? - Oh, sure. mean, actually boredom highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay.
good know, 'cause think people hear boredom think like, oh,
nothing here. - [Anna] Right. - nothing. feel like ton do,
just don't really want it. - Right, right. - opposed something excited
do. - Right, okay, gets sort core things. Also talking
earlier finding passion. going try link together.
basically boredom, first boredom rare experience modern humans,
constantly distracting present moment, infinite
number ways that, right. boredom really, think, important
necessary experience. scary allow bored,
say were, list things hate do, actually got
done. Imagine that. got forthcoming book done,
interviews. - happen! Lightning strike. - Right. walked dog,
cleaned house, went shopping. Imagine moment.
sitting house, guess terrified because, wow,
supposed now, right? nothing really do.
really, really scary. can feel like free fall. yet really important good
experience have. think experience can lot
creative initiative, also really consider priorities values. Okay,
planet Earth. he-haw going life? really care


about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

about? really want spend time, not distracting myself,
know,

00:40:35 Finding Passion Starts Boredom & Action Steps

order spend it. And, know, gets back conversation little bit
earlier finding passion. think one big problems now
misguided idea finding passion, almost people looking
fit key lock thing meant do. - Right,
everything will feel like natural progression? - Right, everything will
wonderful. - can attest fact not works endeavor. - Yeah, right.
great success or. really think answer
lies. really, really believe this. Stop looking passion instead look
around right are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right are,
see needs done. not want do, work
needs done? importantly, doesn't grandiose work.
Like garbage need taken out, right? garbage
neighbor's lawn someone threw there, actually bend pick
put garbage can? Look around you. much work needs
done nobody wants do. really, really important, that,
really think world much better place. people
severe addiction, get recovery, realize. like, not
will going will life world. looking around
needs done. work called moment? also
incredibly freeing don't search perfect thing. lot
burden now young people, find perfect thing,
found perfect thing, going miserable. don't that. Look
life given, look people around you, look jobs present
job simply honorably, one day time, kind
humility. think really striking wisdom people
recovery. incredible humility comes experience. feel
broken, ashamed, pick one day time build life
around can right moment, might benefit another person,
thereby benefit me? - Yeah really important point, willing, like


actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -

instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety

believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,

seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can

dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone

understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key

circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

actually stay issue passion, think dopamine systems,
understand correctly, dopamine systems merge work
referring to, immediacy things calling us, like taking trash, sounds
frankly really boring, honest. hate taking trash, it, 'cause like
clean home like home smells good. least doesn't smell bad.
things, not want offer larger carrot consequence
things. understand correctly, saying act looking
one's immediate environment, acting immediate environment, cultivate
relationship circuits brain action reward that, least
mind, span range small things rewarding, lead us bigger
things rewarding. not like going take trash tend
house. eventually will venture out, eventually will find careers work
those. understand correctly, talking getting sort functional
adaptive action step, action step days tend overlook
mindset things truly outside immediate reality.
correct? - Yeah, beautifully said. just add that,
see lot young people who, example, spend waking hours playing
video games, come say anxious depressed.
majoring computer science. hate it, thought like it. know,
find thing really meant do, life better. first
intervention many many people like see clinical care is,
backwards. don't say quite like that. waiting thing pull
video game world. never going find it, long playing video
games. 'Cause video games powerfully dopaminergic distorted
sense really pleasure pain. will not able find thing
enjoy. course intervention abstain video games, reset reward
pathways, start level balance. invariably happens, just seen
20 years many times become really believer this, sudden like
oh wow, computer science class interesting quarter. like okay, know,
receptivity experiencing pleasure reward way just don't
bombarding reward pathways high dopamine drugs. -
interesting. just underscore notion tending immediate things
can lead super performance. may mentioned earlier episode,
didn't mention now, great privilege close friends


SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

SEAL teams work communities.
remarkable community reasons think people don't understand. People
think, see images, carrying logs beach, this, blowing stuff up,
stuff fun guys like that. guys know SEAL
teams sense duty immediate things, not just holding door
doing, helping dishes moving things around. constantly scanning
environment can done. - Ah! - essentially conquer every
environment in. also competitive human beings
world, it, unless act war fighting, real job.
every environment, benevolent way. remarkable thing
it, think part selected for. And, know,
range there. think hear tending immediate things,
phrase, know, one thing anything. tricky one
me, certain things just don't well. always trying?
think tending to, setting horizon closely tending things one's
immediate environment, think powerful translates, - Yes. - again,
think nervous system, performs algorithms. action steps. brain doesn't
evolve one thing, evolves able use approach lots
different things. - Yes. just want add, even beyond that, 'cause totally
resonates me, consistent people recovery addiction
learn take one day time, one the, know, standard lingo
Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups. think also, say, know,
brain really wired 24-hour period. not good sort the,
know, 10 year, 20. mean huge frontal lobes yes, great planners
can, live much space, can really get anxious
depressed lost, either catastrophize get grandiose. can chunk
day, people recovery talk how, can just today right,
will get chain days seem insignificant individual units, six
months year two years good days, got two good years, right,
look back like oh wow, guess that. think really,
know, one keys, really taking one day time, SEALs, also
connecting environment, right? awake alert
environment, connecting environment, not trying escape it.
course escapism want desire, experience non being.


get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going

want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships

weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction

rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain

get internet drugs whatever is, booby prize.
ultimately takes away immediate environment,
really connect get sense grounded-ness authenticity,
like lives. - Well think unit day something
comes again, discussions colleagues extremely
successful, also balanced lives. - Right. - actually came
discussion Karl Deisseroth, also successful scientist clinician and,
know, manages family, et cetera. unit day, think, fundamental.

00:50:05 Break Addiction

stack up, mentioned. along lines, heard say
order reset dopamine system, essentially order break addictive pattern,
become un-addicted, 30 days zero interaction substance, person, et
cetera. - Right. - correct? - Yeah, 30 days is, clinical experience,
average amount time takes brain reset reward pathways dopamine
transmission regenerate itself. also little bit science suggests
true. imaging studies showing brains still dopamine-deficit
state two weeks using drug. study Schukit
Brown took group depressed men also addicted alcohol, put
hospital they, received no treatment depression no
access alcohol time. four weeks, 80% no longer met criteria
major depression. again, idea depriving high
dopamine high reward substance behavior, allow brains regenerate
dopamine, balance really equilibrate. place can
sort enjoy things. - progressive narrowing - Right. - brings one
pleasure, eventually expands. like dissect 30 days little finely.
also want address one stop something 30 days, thing
thought? kind of, put shelf moment. days one
10, imagine will uncomfortable. - [Anna] Yes. - going
suck basically, quite honest, way described pleasure pain
balance, mind says remove little pleasure one getting, lot
pleasure engaging behavior, gone. pain system really ramped
up. nothing making feel good. just use example. not


recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will
start come week three. week four, people feeling whole lot
better stopped using substance. yeah, to,
hard thing. Like sign it. will say, obviously people
addictions severe long access drug
behavior, not able stop themselves. have, know, higher
levels care, - Sure. - residential treatment. not going everybody,
intervention, amazing many people really severe addictions
things like heroin, cocaine, know, severe pornography addictions. posit this,
experiment. said know what, try experiment. always
amazed, number one, many willing. number two, many
actually able it. able it. little nudge sort
just need, carrot is, know, better life
able taste month. really will able begin see
can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest
anymore. - Yeah. - maybe wrong. Sorry give lift caffeine addicts
there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good

recovery but, know, 10 days going miserable. Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation. - Yes. - point where, know, maybe impulsive, angry.
one expect that? family members people expect that? -
Yeah. say patients, really important piece intervention,
will feel worse feel better. - long, probably first
question ask, right? - Yes. say usually, clinical experience, feel
worse two weeks, can make first two weeks, sun will

can feel better, another way. - way describe seems like
hard, doable people, not everybody. - Yeah, right. - return
category people can't own. Well, days 21 30,
people feeling better. sun starting come out, mentioned,
translates narrative created here, supported biology, dopamine
starting released response taste really good cup coffee, - Yes,
exactly. - instance. Whereas insert, know, addictive
behavior. - Right, right. - Whichever happens be. - course, coffee can
addictive too, leave aside. - Sure, yeah. feel like coffee kind
consumption limiting mechanism built-in, point just can't ingest

there. clutch mug. days 21 30. seen lot people go
addiction addiction treatment. spent lot time places, actually,
looking it, researching. got friends community.



00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better

curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well

tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers

close community. One thing seen again, sadly often
individuals, get sober whatever, great.
people families. people discard normal image addict
insert normal, typical, whatever, healthy person can imagine. 'Cause
lot people wouldn't know addicts. sudden get
call, so-and-so's back jail. So-and-so's wife going leave drank
two bottles wine took Xanax 7:00 a.m., crashed truck pole, got
two beautiful kids. Like happen again? point fourth
fifth time, people just done. mean maybe people, might able detect
frustration voice. dealing this, somebody like, don't even know
want help time. many times, point starting
wonder person just addict. just kind are.
never want give people but, hanging them. will
say many people given them. like talk
context sorts things help people know addicted?
really helps? Not help, really helps. certain people
hopeless? mean, don't like hold conversation way, wouldn't
close real life data didn't ask. hopeless, people just will
not able quit substance use addictive behavior, despite,
assume, really wanting to? - Yeah, people will die disease
addiction, know, think conceptualizing disease helpful frame.
frames use, think, given brain physiologic changes
occur sustained heavy drug use, know happens brain,
really reasonable think brain disease. me, real window of,
say able access compassion around people repeat relapsers, even
life much better recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. - like
no-brainer, right? conceptualize balance dopamine deficit state,
balance tilted side pain. imagine people, month
six months, maybe even six years, balance still tipped side pain.
level balance lost resilience ability restore homeostasis. -
almost like hinge balance - Yes. - messed up. - Exactly. so,


mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,

really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause

neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.



02:01:15 Closing Comments, Resources

mean, someone never experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way
conceptualize is. - Well didn't say that. - [Anna] Oh okay. - clear, not
referring myself, I, example giving, were, come clean.
reveal that. think that, especially hearing lectures
descriptions range things addictive, think fortunate don't
propensity drugs alcohol. - Right, okay. - lucky way. - Right, right.
- Frankly, remove alcohol planet, just relieved no
one will offer more. - [Anna] Right, right. - don't send alcohol.
won't go me. - [Anna] Right. - don't that, like think
compassion, don't empathy for, know, taking really good situation,
outside looks - Right, right. - throwing trash. - Yeah, okay,
let me, really, think, important also come
understanding this, feel 20 years seeing patients.
course addiction spectrum disease, - Sure. - right, got severe
end things. Imagine itch somewhere body, okay. was,
mean, that, like, know, whatever source, super, super itchy.
can go for, know, really focus, go pretty good amount
time not scratching it, moment stopped focusing not scratching it,
scratch it. maybe asleep, right.
happens people severe addiction. balance essentially broken.
Homeostasis not get restored, despite sustained abstinence. living
constant specter pull. never goes away. let say, lots
people addiction go away. goes away four weeks
many them. severe cases, always lingering,
moment not focusing not using, like reflex. fall back it.
not purposeful. not want get high. not value using
drugs family. None that. really cannot not
given opportunity, moment not thinking it.
make sense? - great description actually description can feel
bit empathy, way described scratching itch sleep. - Yeah. -
know, done mosquito bites them, - Right. -
scratching, know, like wake scratching mosquito bite. also
admit experienced not feeling like want pick phone
rewarding, just finding it. - Yes, course, yes. - Like not going


use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got

slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.

Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned

use thing, not going use thing, just finding it, like
here? - Yes, right, right. - Sort get back again? -
Yes, right. - know enough brain function understand circuits
generate deliberate behavior. circuits generate reflexive behavior.
one goals nervous system make deliberate stuff reflexive,
don't make decision, decision-making costly thing
do. - Exactly. - Decision-making kind. - [Anna] Right, right. - really
help. want just try weave together dopamine puzzle, however,
week, first phase 30 40 day detox, like dopamine fast, - Right. - right,
okay. First 10 days miserable. Middle 10 days, clouds out, may
shards sunlight coming through. sudden sun starts come
out, gets brighter brighter. people will relapse, not just
getting fired job spouse leaving them, things going really
well? - Yes. - unconscious mechanism? 'Cause seen before.
great win, friend really impressive creative. don't want reveal
that. relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity create
entire world. like can happen? now beginning wonder,
dopamine associated win opened spigot dopamine
system? happened phase really great stretch life. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, raise great point triggers, right? triggers things
make us want go back using drug. key thing triggers, whatever
are, also release little bit dopamine, right? just thinking
whatever trigger associate drug use, just thinking drug use,
can already release anticipatory dopamine, new little mini spike.
part think really fascinating. mini spike followed mini deficit state.
goes doesn't go back baseline, goes baseline tonic
levels. craving, right? anticipation immediately followed wanting
drug. dopamine deficit state drives motivation go get
drug. many people talk dopamine not really pleasure,
wanting motivation. deficit state drives
locomotion get it. - earlier description dopamine involved
desire more, giving sense reward, also movement. - Right. -
assume things braided together - Yes, yes. - nervous system,
specific intention feel something good, feel pain. - Yes. -


maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want
celebrate, know, want to, reward happened, want put reward
there. really really fascinating people come realization
themselves, vulnerable things going well, really
valuable insight can put things place barriers place
go meetings whatever do, know, protect themselves. -
Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned

maybe don't notice it. next thing know, pursuing
thing that- - love way use word braided together, beautiful.
let also just say, something find also fascinating work patients,
see time. people bad life experiences, loss,
know, form, stress, many different forms, trigger,
absolutely people trigger things going well. things going well can
like reward things going well, often removal
hypervigilant state required keep use check. sense want

Along lines, friend 40 years sober, severe drug alcohol addict
young age. Really impressive person, lot important work
kind at-risk youth community Hawaii. said something me, said,
former addicts often do, got great sayings. think fits well
describing. said, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch. said well kind depressing, said
no, actually gives peace. - Yeah. - happen
many years relapsing relapsing, recovering relapsing, felt like
hopeless. somehow conceptualizing vigilance can never go away,
instead making feel burdened, - Yeah. - made feel relieved. often think
statement, know, no matter far drive, always
distance ditch, mind conceptualize gosh, tough
way drive road. actually, road know ditch
know lanes lines are, actually pretty nice drive.
don't know shoulder is, constantly looking around.
this, speaking now analogies imagery science. I, one
things find incredible community 12-step, variety
them, communities create themselves, sayings,
believe link back really core biological mechanisms. - Yes, yes. - want
ask communities. question might little bit
controversial.



01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends
propensity drug alcohol addiction, not them, certainly
them, talking recovery, feel like talk about.
meeting, meeting, meeting. really asking that, can
become addicted sobriety? - Right. great question links
things talking about, settle out,
know? way live pleasure pain? implied earlier
ultimately want resilient balance sensitive pleasure pain, can
easily restore homeostasis indulge, even indulge greatly. truth
matter people severe addiction, believe temperamentally want
extremes, wired kind intensity just slight
adjustments around fulcrum, right? like want big highs big lows. -
say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive
people given meeting, bonded feel people given meeting. -
Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative

great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned

01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted “Sobriety”?

- Great! - is, possible people addicted drugs alcohol
gambling, behavior, get addicted addiction community?
one thing think observe circuit brain
human beings tell dream night before,
whatever reason. another circuit leads people wake up,
can't sleep. don't know circuit is. facetious here.
seem also circuit brain addicts discuss want kind talk
recovery lot. mention not poke them, rather opposite,
think one thing challenging, least me, friends

say great meeting. - Yeah, right, right. - like amazing
meeting. find group, - Right, yeah. - find group location. - Yeah. -
almost inside joke communities. Again, not reporting, not
talking friend quotes, isn't reporting. talk attractive

Right, right. - meetings - Right. - become form
dopamine hit. - Yes, yes, yes. - again, not disparaging, just, want
understand this. - Right, yes, lot times patients will say me, oh, know,
don't want go AA. cult. response cult exactly
works, okay. yes, much better addicted AA
recovery, almost addiction think of. know Rob


Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships
relationships, one person not recovery. Like going many
meetings, always talking recovery, know what, much better
intoxicated, right? mean, although may tire friends talking
meetings time, sure rather

work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -

understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

Malenka's work, Stanford, oxytocin, know, hormone
involved human pair bonding relationships love. directly links
dopamine neurons causes release dopamine. yes, connect
humans, especially kind transcendent spiritual way, huge dopamine
hit. replace dopamine people get drugs. people
addiction temperament, need intense level. not going
generally satisfied kind of, know, sort acquaintanceship, right?
want intensity intimacy get people cathartically
exposing, know, warts all. yes, people can get addicted recovery,
good them. Go it, know. course can disruptive friendships

01:11:45 Wired Addiction?

than, know, addictions. - Absolutely. now second time
done discussion, now empathy way
describe enthusiasm meetings, - Yes. - probably way people feel
work. - Yes, right. - neuroscience. - Yes. - mean, getting
front class since eight years old talking things read
weekend. Now just happen thing called podcast. - Right. -
since little. annoys lot people, right. learned suppress
little bit. people like it, poking fun just say now can
understand way feel reports yet another amazing meeting or,
different form this. people just love
intense experiences. - Yes. - always like trying pull off Bali
talking sensual time, sure Bali's wonderful.
kind ratcheting up, like seeking Burning Man year long. - Right. - never
Burning Man, no desire go Burning Man. inside academia mean
just turn mirror myself, inside academia, Silicon Valley, work,
- Right. - pursuit success, even money kind divorced that,
sometimes sometimes isn't. Academic work is, know, sake pursuit


knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

knowledge. sounds like mechanism. fact, feels much
like mechanism. - Andrew, love you. First all,
willing bring flaws foibles conversation. - Well
everywhere. - Well, know what, wonderful. really open
curious wanting understand, 'cause can't tell many people met
really see addiction kind otherness. truth wired
addiction. not addicted yet just, right around corner. know
mean? Especially incredible panoply new drugs behaviors
there. love willing take moment really try understand this,
is, can relate, relating your, essentially work
addiction right apt. just happen addicted something really
socially rewarded. know, figured early age. Oh, X, Y
Z, people go look smart kid, whatever is, know. - Well
me, made feel safe. - Okay. - felt like. Yeah, just felt like this, pause
'cause like, like peace. like ah, can relax moment. - talking
neuroscience? - just feel like right path. - Yeah, okay. -
onto something. see something excited about, - Right. - like, feel
filled with, must dopamine. - Yes. - feel flooded pleasure, literally head
toe. - Right, yeah. - next thought more. [laughing] - true, true
addict. - Okay, thank you. - are. are. just got really, - think thank you. -
really got lucky fact drawn adaptive, essentially,
know. challenge going life doesn't get balance
sense 24/7 working, don't stop things think
of- - life, admittedly, somewhat asymmetric. mean components
physical health, et cetera, somewhat asymmetric. got dog.
Although talk awful lot, so. - dog good draws
little bit away work. again, know, think key
people feel like don't, never experienced addiction
don't know anybody addiction, do, don't get it, just think one
thing important thing life do, gives pleasure
meaning purpose. imagine couldn't it. - Oh yeah, not talk
that. - [Anna] Right.

01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction



- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

- Well appreciate feedback can send bill end.
ridiculous sounding addiction ever witnessed, actually real
addiction, along lines. think know standard heroin, pill.
very, mention, important, previous book, will
provide link well, focused opioid crisis thought
medication. turned just bad, not worse, lot so-called street
drugs. understand those, know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now
video games. talk social media little bit depth.
like, wow, didn't realize people get addicted that? - Water. - Really? - Really.
lovely patient was, severe alcohol addiction, got
recovery alcohol addiction many years. kind sort
polydipsia, urge drinking something lot. drank lot water
slowly, time, realized drank enough water, become
hyponatremic delirious herself. - can die it, right? - Right,
is, just wanted head. periodically
intentionally overdose water, order, know, to, know, sad, sad. -
happened her? - eventually took life. - Wow. - Yeah, really. -
rough. - lovely woman. bright. many interests
passions, course sad when, know, died.
wow me, like wow, disease addiction, can even
get addicted water. - Wow. think just underscores generalizability
circuits. - Right. - isn't brain circuit addiction water happened
have. brain circuit pleasure pain addiction, water plugged
circuit. - Right, right. - Wow.

01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Heroes

intense. book, "Dopamine Nation", also describe amazing paths
recovery. People that, know, reading would, won't say ones
'cause great surprises book too, tragic triumphant,
say. often described patients heroes. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us
little bit that. - know, think hard give
drug behavior addicted to, much courage takes fortitude


discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting
images, say. Really, really, really hard. yet people find way
it. think absolutely amazing. really wise people. much
wisdom offer. taught lot. know, talk book
addictions,

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.

anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know

discipline, stick it-ness, people really amazing people. mean
that's, don't know it, do, know. like, know,
talked little bit just constant ever-present urge use, even sustained
periods abstinence people. really really hard. course
double shame feel, urge, even lives
much better. mean people really, really remarkable. take
remarkable accomplishment imagine world live now,
constantly invited tempted really bombarded opportunities
become addicted- - like feeling itch everywhere. - Oh yeah, mean can't
escape it. know, cannot escape it. get email inbox inviting
X, Y, Z. addicted thing, know, try like delete
apps not go here. sudden work inbox, know, getting

01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame

really just like took page right their, okay, now? right,
patient do, that, okay, going try that. - amazing
community - Yeah. - people, sage. wanted just touch something
mentioned, shame. - Yeah. - know can't go meeting,
talk addicts, without detecting hearing like lies, shame, et cetera. heard
say interview somebody else recently truth-telling secrets sort
core recovery. yeah, tell us that. - Yeah. one things
found really fascinating working people recovery, telling
truth, even merest detail lives, central recovery.
became really curious that. Like truth-telling important?
course obvious thing people addiction, lying
using, know. part getting recovery stop lying people
care about, use. really people
recovery taught not even just not lying using drugs.
not lie anything. can't lie late work morning,


all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,

all. Oh hit traffic, no didn't hit traffic, wanted spend two minutes reading
paper drinking coffee, right. just lying about, know, don't know
dinner. Like, people addiction will get into, know, lying habit
lying random stuff, 'cause sort habit lying.
recovery really telling truth, know, ways. one
things I, lot fun writing book, sort exploring
neuroscience around truth-telling important leading balanced life.
know like every religion, since beginning time, telling truth. Well
why, right? really interesting neuroscience behind suggests
tell truth, actually potentially strengthen prefrontal cortical circuits,
connections limbic brain reward brain. course,
circuits get disconnected addiction, right? balance,
reward pathway, limbic brain, emotion brain, one thing, cortical
circuits completely disengaged that, ignoring happening, easy
reflexive. don't need think balance balance
happening. re-engage circuits, anticipate future consequences,
think drink, know, not just going feel now use,
going feel tomorrow six months now? telling truth fact
way that, make connections stronger. talk studies
book kind indirectly show that. find really fascinating, plus just
like open honest people really create intimate connections,
intimate connections create dopamine. talking little bit
know bunch people need like intensity lives. me, need lot
intensity human connections. Like really not interested in, bored
made anxious by, casual interactions. know, like kind discussion
you, intense also intimate self-disclosing, rewarding
me. important source dopamine. Thank God became psychiatrist. -
Yeah, absolutely. - Like can't disclose stuff, quite transparent
patients, slightly unorthodox. But, know, think right, also
transparent them. that's, know, source dopamine too,
honest disclose. think people going run away you, tell
like weird neuroses, really don't. like oh
thank God, not one, right. - love about, love many things
book. read one sweep. - Oh thank you. - like wow. pleasantly


surprised, like wow, really opening book,
beginning. don't want give away, yeah, open
appropriate. also think question truth-telling, always think
like tell truth, hundred percent truth, also element
report previous lies, right? prior behavior? fascinated
'cause telling truth many facets, three sides thing
mind, one reporting everything accurately. withhold,
not withhold, right? people say tell truth, least don't
lie. sort a- - Lies omission, right. - Yeah, lies omission. Lies omission.
the, assume people, small enormous
batch things lied past, still thread future. - Right. -
important addict, every person really, to, 'cause sounds like
cultivating circuitry prefrontal cortex dopamine system
great anybody. Since addicts, - Right. - everyone it.
seriousness, sounds like good thing everybody do. much work needs
done priors, stuff hidden? mean not me, stuff
everybody else hidden. - Yeah, the, know, steps 12-steps
Alcoholics Anonymous, good number steps thing.
past, ways harmed people past. fourth step making
amends, know, admitting ways contributed harming
others. really big piece recovery. So, know, important,
people addiction, really, really important go back make amends. And,
know, key idea just go back apologize, know, don't
get particular kind response, don't need forgiven. act
apologizing ways harmed lied people past,
cathartic renewing, allows us kind shed skin new
lives begin again. Sort absolved, know, past sins, speak.
really important. know, situations maybe not good idea,
person nature? Sure, know, always going be,
doesn't like, not, talking not like Kant's idea never lie,
robbers house. stowaway. can't lie even that. like no,
probably situations where, - Absolutely. - know. - sake
people's safety, - Right, and- - children's safety, sure. - Right, mean are, can
think million scenarios. general, know, taking stock,


don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good

something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA



regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
get point thought little bit hard know coming
next. easy check phone check email, look something
internet. never get opportunity finish thought,
really source creative energy original thought, right. not just reacting
coming you. - Right, something contribute world. -
right. - big believer either consuming creating.
is, mention, important, believe neutral time. think sleep
great. big proponent sleep talked lot podcast, care
lot sleep. not just sake performance. actually just really like sleep.
think constant consumer visual information information kinds,
can problem. really great sources information

01:51:25 Narcissism

internet. - Yes. - certainly benefit fact channels exist.
Narcissistic pre-occupation. narcissist? - know, first all, healthy- -
fact asked, take of, narcissist never ask
question? - Oh yes, highly sophisticated narcissist - Oh see. - know that.
- Well not sophisticated. - healthy narcissism, means
invest personal energies things care about. competence
arena threatened, experience narcissistic injury, normal
healthy. living narcissistic culture, mean not news,
preoccupation individual achievement individual self-worth individual self-
confidence. think just fueled social media, not just
seeing ourselves, seeing people's reactions ourselves, every single,
know, thing say do, know, get likes that. really
insidious contributes, think, ultimately lot personal shame,


not really meant individuals bouncing around universe. social animals.
probably generally happiest, even natural contrarians among us,
part tribe, right. much kind separate
tribe, think brain's natural instinctive corrective mechanism
self-loathing shame. So, know, ironic culture tells us
just achieve more, like more. truth actually opposite.
think people get pinnacles personal achievement, know,
things like imposter syndrome whatever, know. - just, know,
Stanford lot high achievers. - Right. - Right.

01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise

phenomenal, amazing people like colleagues mine just,
always awe. Like just amazing, like mean shifted high. also
people amazing paths get here, coming little accomplishing
much. also pressure, - Yeah. - right. know, way career
described day got job, one colleague mine, late Ben
Barres said, welcome schizophrenia 'cause never going able complete
anything without getting interrupted. partially true, although created
buffers. one, successful scientist, member National Academy,
et cetera, said me, know, just remember, pinball. never win. best
can just keep playing. - Yes, right. - thought wow, okay. Okay.
just go. - Right. - think achieve more, not just academics course,
anyone achieves more, relishing accomplishment. often
desire more, also pressure of, well now next
30 years, even though love it. pressure of, well, mountain high,
get here, start shoveling dirt
can keep climbing. lot work. - [Anna] Yes. - think perception
success roar crowd cruise. don't cruise. just
give do. - Right. - give do. - Well think is,
least life experience, heard people well, know,
prize going for, get unsatisfying. prize
never imagined kind go, well, happen, gee, know,
feels good. very, the- - like mirage - Yeah. - one case. -


Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,
referring - No no, fine. - Anna whole way through, 'cause
colleagues, thank much sharing information. know learned
ton. know everyone else going learn lot addiction good
side dopamine.

don't know you, lot regrets guilt lot things life.
kind haunt me, know. means nightmares, right. think
true people. mean occasionally will meet somebody like don't
regrets life, like wow. Like cannot relate all. So, know,
idea like catharsis and, well, mean, 12-steps telling God, higher
power, telling another human being, ways wronged others.
Considering character defects contributed. me,
really important piece something don't enough current culture.
Especially psychiatry, frankly, like lot eternally empathizing
patients, not whole lot likes going well, know, actually kind messed
up. like really bad you, know. work, don't necessarily
use language, but, know, patients might say like really feel badly about,
know, thing. like yeah, get it. understand feel. - Well guilt a- -
[Anna] Right. - circuit too. - Right, important, right, also
important recovery not becoming addicted. Experiencing certain amount
appropriate shame things done and, know, feeling pain
comes shame, incredibly painful emotion, right. think may
one try avoid other, like shame not liked
not accepted not celebrated. - thing really
despicable. - Right, really, yeah, like oh God, horrible thing, right, right.
So, mean, done horrible things haven't gone back said horrible
thing, I'm, maybe tried pay forward. Like told kids, know,
younger horrible thing still haunts me. ever tempted
something like did, might think situation. So, know, kind
way. think wrestling important. - think really important element
this, not, love neuroscience done truth-telling, -
Yeah. - value truth-telling. - Yeah. - think, predict new truly
exciting area people going really curious about, huge sphere call
neuroscience, hope continue work. Also, glad hear
happening Stanford. - No that's, literature look isn't Stanford work,
work. - Great. - might people Stanford. - Great,

Yeah. - almost like dopamine can create mirages. - Yes. -
place there. - right. just, pot gold. just- - Constant dopamine.
- Right, right, right. - Constant dopamine. - think, know, really,
think, related discussion earlier taking one day time, paying
attention that, know, 24-hour period environment. absolutely
fascinated ways accumulate success, that, totally
independent desire success. really process-oriented. like,
today? can make today good meaningful day, little bit better, good
days had? Constantly tweaking experimenting
experiment call human existence. way
authentic paying attention value-driven, whatever our, know, values
informed by, very, interesting days accumulate, find,
well, guess contributed something value there, wasn't trying that.
know, think really, mean, amazed like, know, 20 years ago
went Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, know, just, happy
just good doctor. like, guess just going try figure
good doctor, learn that. now see medical students,
wonderful. brilliant - are. - well-intentioned, that.
like can I, know, write great American novel, startup, go Africa,
apply grant? know, like, really, just trying learn
doctor. it's, say, lot pressure them. also kind weird
leapfrogging real way accomplish something. - Right. - isn't like oh
can accomplish something. like, can today service.
Right? finding trying service, know, not really going
recognition, can sometimes lead people call success, although wasn't
aiming for. - beautiful not aiming for.
- Oh much better, much better. - Yeah, big believer one can align
compulsion greater good. - Yes, right. - service humanity

01:58:10 Reciprocity

planet animals, whatever is, really good stuff emerges.
lot reciprocity there. world starts to, supporting world
starts support way feels fluid. - comes back. Right,


mean speaks like generosity me, vis-a-vis book.
say- - Well, love book. - know, it's- - like, not business deal
folks. just purely heard Anna lecture course, wanted learn
dopamine. taught me, asked come podcast. Turned
wrote amazing book. sent advanced copy book. read
one sweep, incredible. love it. just like eight year old version me, now
45 version myself, can't stop blabbing things love. - Well
awesome, say, surprised generosity. not something
encountered frequently Stanford, wonderful place.
general sense give away somebody else, lost something, not
right way think it. Not are, also not world works, 'cause
give away people, get back much more. takes long time
might not come path. - never think reciprocity.
weaned good advisers. - nice, - Yeah. - yeah. - think just sort got
drilled give, better immediate life is. - Yes, yeah. -
also don't long-term vision, know. just, just excited book.
excited people learning brain dopamine. admit,
grown neuroscience essentially, not understand pleasure pain
orchestrated way are. mindful now. - Oh good. -
changed number behaviors. know number people going
questions want get contact you. not social media. -
correct, yes. - true ideology. great. - reason
just, wouldn't able control myself. mean, really drug. People
drug, intimacy drug, wouldn't able manage it. just,
just easier not all, rather try moderate it. - Well book,
mentioned before, can attest to, certain intimacy. People get know
book. definitely check book. questions
book, et cetera, welcome send way. will buffer
questions. filter them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, formal, forgive me,

regardless happening. rest please. want ask
using drugs treat drug addiction. days growing interest,
least discussion ibogaine. People going down, going country,
think still illegal here, illegal here, going country to, dunno, either inject
smoke whatever is. people going Ayahuasca journeys MDMA,
still illegal drug country, clinical trials. people
campus experimental studies. don't know clinical trials, Johns
Hopkins clinical trials, et cetera. vast area, right? Different
chemistries different drugs different purposes. rationale, understand
it, take people pattern addiction, launch experience
also chemical extreme, often extreme serotonin extreme dopamine
type. MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy instance. Tons serotonin dumped, tons
dopamine dumped. neurotoxic, neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not
topic now. lot. somehow extreme experience wrapped inside
supported network there, whether not just someone whether not
actively working something patient, supposed eject
person life drug use isn't much interest. violates, purely
rational level, violates everything talked terms dopamine biology.
would, arrangement way described it, cause addiction, anything
dopamine fast, dopamine feast. hear successful transitions
this, least anecdotally, maybe clinical studies. going on?
going on? doesn't make sense me. Yeah. - Yeah, think good
skeptical. think skeptical. said that, clinical studies
showing, know, small studies short duration, small
number subjects, but, know, taking people example, addicted
alcohol, this, say psychedelic experience
controlled setting. - either, typically high dose psilocybin, three dose, saw
MAP study MDMA. - Right. - ecstasy. sort the, seem
kind of, - Yes, typical, right. - kind bread butter kind work. -
Right, right. thing really keep mind completely interwoven
regular psychotherapy, highly selected individuals. - clinical trials. -
Right, right. clinical- - referring legal clinical trials. - Right, right.
so, know, think metaphor helps think many
ways top mountain, sort like taking gondola instead


walking up. sort of, instead like year psychoanalysis sitting
couch every week reflecting life, condensed version
psychoanalysis psychotherapy, plus, know, MDMA, gets faster. -
creates intimacy, presumably, the- - Well think main thing
happens beneficial, just allows person get outside head
look lives much broader sweep, consider not mired
quotidian sort details life, rather human large planet
Earth, vast universe. think takes, like works,
transformational experience gives person another lens
view lives, think people positive powerful, can
come back like oh gosh, care family, don't, want
X, Y, Z them. realize continuing drink not going to, know,
achieve that. almost like spiritual values-based. think can
powerful, said that, truly quite skeptical because, know, addiction
chronic relapsing remitting problem. hard imagine
something works quickly short-term, going work disease
really long-lasting. - Yeah, two addicts know MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy part thing, got worse. - Yeah. - people know
severe trauma this, took approach, seem better. -
Okay, interesting. - I, think discussion, hear now, just sort
psychedelics, huge category includes many different drugs
compounds different effects. hear trauma addiction lumped
together. think splitter, not lumper, say science. think
going important people know definitely not one-size fits kind
thing. sounds like may utility certain conditions. - Yeah,
think so. trying open-minded potential utility certain
individuals. can tell clinical work, concerning unintended
consequence narrative, lot people looking kind
spiritual awakening own, not context kind therapeutic,
psychological work, know, microdose want try psilocybin MDMA friend
wherever, can spiritual experience can figure
lives. disaster almost never works well. people
literally, supposedly can't get addicted psychedelics because, know,
something biochemistry don't fully understand, 'cause doesn't make


sense me. patients clinically definitely addicted to, know,
MDMA, micro-dosing. concerning 'cause like, know, Pollan's
"How Change Mind", respect work, hand, penetrated
culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - don't know
don't problem taking stance. just say stance narrative
popular authors can expand wick fast, - Yes. - pretty soon people
essentially taking mental health hands. actually, great
optimism business clinical use psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins fabulous work this. others too,
course. controlled settings. - Right. - pharmacology tuned
up. one thing think coming. several papers published recently
great journals like nature science, et cetera, scientists
removing hallucinogenic components drugs finding still
antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - experience psychedelic,
long-term effects psychedelic, might actually dissociable. so, I,
always careful say neither something it. just think
treading carefully important. - agree you, can just tell
downstream effect average person, many present clinic,
misconstrued data use psychedelics mental health conditions,
idea safe, anybody can take circumstance
kind awakening. not data show, right? data
highly controlled settings, know, carefully selected patients. worry,
know. - Sure. going sitting Matthew Johnson point,
discuss this. think that, ah, care cocoon real clinical care,
seem important component. - Yes. - Well glad touch
and, know, sure get bunch comments telling that, know.
think important explore things sides, do, scientists. -
Yes. - Michael Pollan wants chat, can too. fine. much
enjoyed book actually. - Yes, yes. - think people run ideas. -
right. - don't walk them, sprint. - right, right.

01:40:20 Social Media Addiction

Yeah. - couple things just want touch on, relate


social media. - [Anna] Okay. - featured "The Social Dilemma".
powerful movie. think many people avoided seeing movie reflects back
us just addicted manipulated are. - [Anna] Yes. -
doesn't seem changed behavior much. say movie changed
understanding perception, not behavior much. look addiction
maladaptive thing, something making lives worse us less functional
work relationships, imagine version social media making
connected. mean podcast all. - Yes, yes. - post videos. will
show YouTube elements Instagram well. much like sugar
things, imagine need regulate, not necessarily eliminate,
behavior. want talk looks like. want talk
referred narcissistic preoccupation social media creating.
far keenly aware look sound
perceived, 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - first all, social
media, addicting really? healthy social media behavior? -
first message want get across social media, really drug
engineered drug. based on, know, potency, quantity, variety,
bottomless polls, likes, way enumerated, that. doesn't mean
can't use it, need thoughtful way use it, just like
need thoughtful way use drug. means
intention advance, planning use, right. trying use really
awesome tool potentially connect people, not used get
lost it. course, know, people going come different propensities
addiction drug, true social media too. people will no
problem using moderation using way adaptive. people will
immediately get sucked in. key thing getting addicted
happening, nobody getting addicted thinks getting addicted, right.
face it, fact go woops, know, about? -
Remember texting driving, books texting driving,
terrible was. - Yeah. - Even governments largely given up. see
billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text drive, text can wait, whatever. Not
worth dying for. - Right, right. - everybody's texting driving. - Right
look young people today, teenagers, mean basically cybernetically enhanced,
phone there. know, like talking texting 12 friends


time, no stopping it. mean genie bottle where,
know, not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - need figure out,
know, make tool something that's, know, going good us not
ultimately harmful. don't answers stretch imagination,
think, know, wisdom learned using drugs,
also applies social media. say to, again, put barriers place
allow us remain control use, means not much, know, not
often, not potent. - think in, going back idea unit day
good attractable unit, manageable unit time people,
saying advance, allocating two hours going allow
free reign use phone apps things, even
restricted that, meaning okay, going allow 30 minutes day
post comment, closeout completely. - Yeah, think it's,
depends person sort combination. talked earlier about, know,
itch scratching night. gotten point
smartphones, people pulling utterly unconscious so,
pulling out, know, couple texts, couple. don't know it!
- friend works in, delivers babies, many pregnant mothers won't
actually deliver without phone hand. used hand
connected spouse. may comment spouses phones.
sounds like kind security blanket sorts. - Right, like transitional
object, yeah. - Actually reminds me, referred phone, think
phone, maybe online persona ourselves, become sort infantile
need for, like baby bottle. - Right, right. - wonder
regressed, think regressed bit terms online behavior.
inability act like. always thought adult somebody can control
behavior. - Yeah. - difference baby adult. don't
developmental neurobiologist long understand young organism
can't control behavior, older one can. me, mature organism, mature
years organism can't control behavior, baby. immature version itself.
neuroscience support statement. look behavior
phone sometimes think, grown man. Like problem here, right?
know, don't eat baby food, acting like baby phone, right,
sense reflexively picking up, not intentioned deliberate it.


need full 30 days, Anna? - yes, so- - 30 days away phone? -
know, recommend, full 30 days reset. severely addicted,
recommend 30 days. just little bit addicted, like us,
probably don't need 30 days. fact, single day, not challenging,
probably may sufficient. - phone off substantial segments day. - Okay,
great. - drives people crazy. People expect respond. don't
care. - Yeah, right, right. - really don't. actually take little bit pleasure
fact that, well, think point trying make right one,
not just right me, like why, don't see clause text messages emails
say must responded within X amount time else, else. take
liberty replying able to. - Yeah, right. - want to. - Right,
touches one big challenges social media, us
spending time social media, divesting libidinous
energies, et cetera, real-life interactions. means even want
choose not online connecting, go outside no there, right.
nobody else there. think collective challenge,
mission, make sure preserving maintaining offline ways connect
other. 'Cause don't lonely, right, not
online. tribe folks can with, none
phones together discreet amount time, wonderful
liberating nobody's distracted. think really key. think young
people figuring out, know. trying create spaces try to,
say, instead dopamine fast yourself, friends, right.
FOMO less, fear missing because, oh
dopamine fast together. tricks can come with. -
like that. - Yeah, okay good. - like that. don't allow, home gym love
working out. just enjoy always have. don't allow phone gym
anymore. - Right. - live area don't get reception, like two meters
outside door. dog walks now just, boring hell. - Yes. -
also bulldog, doesn't like walk. really slow. boring
- Yes. - used taking calls walk, - Right. - super
efficient that. walks now favorite part day, - Yeah,
right. - because, phone, get call one brought
reception areas, dismayed. - Yeah, right. - can attest this,


don't think phone addict, put work regulating phone behavior.
- Yeah, key. to, intention, prior situation, think
literal, physical metacognitive barriers can put
phone, whatever drug is, create intentional spaces not
constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, distracting yourself, really
think, know, think talked just started interview, know,
losing ability sustained thought, right? mean get far then,
