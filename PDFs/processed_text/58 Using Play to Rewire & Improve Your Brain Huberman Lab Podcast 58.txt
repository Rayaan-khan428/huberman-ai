come across bunch papers say brain area connects brain area,
controls play animals. similar areas babies adults.


indeed, true. will talk brain circuitry, think importantly
understand utility play? know, play younger?
tend play less get older? world play for?
us categorized playful. sure know, people like this, maybe
like people can walk room, social setting kind,
seem already kind playful, maybe even mischievous quality them.
talk mischief little bit later, sort look environment

tend engage spontaneous play earlier years later years.
therein lies interesting portal understanding utility,
purpose play is. First all, want lay couple key facts play
point fact play not just games. Play much, much
play particular, played child still can play adults
really test expand potential roles kinds interactions. One
important, interesting surprising features play like everyone know
homeostatically regulated. familiar term
homeostasis. Homeostasis just aspect biological systems try remain

considered kind luminary field play, great title have, right?


title scientific luminary, might well the, play
guy. fact known get later why, known
"Rat Tickler" tickled rats. actually found rodents animals

called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,
appropriate devices, able colleagues isolate so-called "Rat
Laughter" turns kitten laughter puppy laughter.
course human laughter. Jaak Panksepp interesting pioneering
person field. also discovered play homeostatically regulated.
Meaning animals including children restricted playing certain amount
time, will play given opportunity way food restrict

important moves thing call play dimension
higher order functions things evolved recently, know, really kind
front edge human evolution, deeper circuitry brain, whereby say
brain stem, kind ancient parts brain going involved. fact,

will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different

uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing

crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take

absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access

hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached

something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought

involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes

neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,

come across bunch papers say brain area connects brain area,
controls play animals. similar areas babies adults.


indeed, true. will talk brain circuitry, think importantly
understand utility play? know, play younger?
tend play less get older? world play for?
us categorized playful. sure know, people like this, maybe
like people can walk room, social setting kind,
seem already kind playful, maybe even mischievous quality them.
talk mischief little bit later, sort look environment
social setting opportunity different kinds novel interactions. people
probably put category. walk novel environment, tend
mode just assessing environment like. not particularly
spontaneously playful person, although around certain individuals, might
spontaneously playful. continuum kind seriousness playful
nature. Turns young animals, including humans playfulness
tend engage spontaneous play earlier years later years.
therein lies interesting portal understanding utility,
purpose play is. First all, want lay couple key facts play
point fact play not just games. Play much, much
play particular, played child still can play adults
really test expand potential roles kinds interactions. One
important, interesting surprising features play like everyone know
homeostatically regulated. familiar term
homeostasis. Homeostasis just aspect biological systems try remain
balance. know, stay awake long period time, tend want sleep
long period time. slept long period time rested,
tend energetic next day. course, know people
will immediately say, oh, well, sleep long, groggy next day. course
exceptions, general, sleep wakefulness homeostatic balance.
Thirst water consumption homeostatic balance. don't drink fluids

likewise food. Likewise, motivated behaviors. Well, one
important discoveries last century, largely work guy named Jaak
Panksepp. No, not Jack Jaak Panksepp really pioneered understanding
biology play relating psychology play animals humans.
considered kind luminary field play, great title have, right?


title scientific luminary, might well the, play
guy. fact known get later why, known
"Rat Tickler" tickled rats. actually found rodents animals
many kind generate laughter response tickling. fact, don't
capacity tickle something also talk is.
called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,
appropriate devices, able colleagues isolate so-called "Rat
Laughter" turns kitten laughter puppy laughter.
course human laughter. Jaak Panksepp interesting pioneering
person field. also discovered play homeostatically regulated.
Meaning animals including children restricted playing certain amount
time, will play given opportunity way food restrict
long period time, eat finally allowed eat. Now
important moves thing call play dimension
higher order functions things evolved recently, know, really kind
front edge human evolution, deeper circuitry brain, whereby say
brain stem, kind ancient parts brain going involved. fact,
case going learn later podcast, play generated
connectivity many brain areas. one key brain areas area called PAG
Periaqueductal Gray. Periaqueductal Gray brain stem area. pretty far
back brain kind transitions spinal cord. rich neurons
make endogenous opioids. not kinds opioids causing
opioid crisis. neurons release endogenous,
meaning self-made biologically made opioids. go names like enkephalin
things sort. Play evokes small amounts opioid release system.
kind dope little bit, not much one see one take
exogenous opioids. fact exogenous opioids now know, potentially
hazardous, highly high addiction potential high overdose potential. cause sorts

brain allows areas brain, like prefrontal cortex, area
front responsible call executive function. Executive function
ability make predictions, assess contingencies. Like this, happens.
that, happens. Well prefrontal cortex often seen kind rigid
executive whole brain. one way view it, probably better way view
prefrontal cortex works concert primitive
circuitries. periaqueductal gray releases endogenous opioids
play, prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid. actually gets smarter. develops
ability take different roles explore different contingencies. going
talk role play later different contexts. will find much
play really exploring things way feels safe enough explore, right?
not happens drive street bike
street, headed work, commuting bicycle walking driving,
tend linear tend goal directed. not going just take
new street just not going spontaneously riding middle
road sidewalk back forth. Although can remember
kid, that. like jump off curb cuts kid.
eventually graduated, sorry cyclist, graduated skateboarding.
look skateboarding. always kind exploring terrain, know, got
older, actually find becoming much linear. just don't play
commute much. really just getting work working.
endogenous opioids system, mode play, prefrontal
cortex starts seeing exploring many possibilities interact
environment, others roles can assume ourselves.
going dissect one one, different aspects play, role play, social play, individual
play, imaginary play, competitive play enormous number dimensions play.
end episode, going arrive key feature. key
feature one called personal play identity. us call
personal play identity. personal play identity laid development.
identity assume playful scenarios. identity adopt
non playful scenarios. Now great news personal play identity plastic
throughout entire lifespan. can adjust personal play identity ways


will benefit work relationships overall level happiness. will

excuse me, Jaak Panksepp, "The rat tickler." also want just give nod play
generally, move forward discussion. love everyone
stop thinking play just child activity, not just sport related activity, really

child psychology, somewhat famous poem written research child

imagine mind. "If can take away you, mine. little

course, hear sounds quite awful, right? yet actually

will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number

definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,

endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money

However, hyper focused something rigidly attached

ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill

adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand

business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction

Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought

pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,

come across bunch papers say brain area connects brain area,
controls play animals. similar areas babies adults.


indeed, true. will talk brain circuitry, think importantly
understand utility play? know, play younger?
tend play less get older? world play for?
us categorized playful. sure know, people like this, maybe
like people can walk room, social setting kind,
seem already kind playful, maybe even mischievous quality them.
talk mischief little bit later, sort look environment
social setting opportunity different kinds novel interactions. people
probably put category. walk novel environment, tend
mode just assessing environment like. not particularly
spontaneously playful person, although around certain individuals, might
spontaneously playful. continuum kind seriousness playful
nature. Turns young animals, including humans playfulness
tend engage spontaneous play earlier years later years.
therein lies interesting portal understanding utility,
purpose play is. First all, want lay couple key facts play
point fact play not just games. Play much, much
play particular, played child still can play adults
really test expand potential roles kinds interactions. One
important, interesting surprising features play like everyone know
homeostatically regulated. familiar term
homeostasis. Homeostasis just aspect biological systems try remain
balance. know, stay awake long period time, tend want sleep
long period time. slept long period time rested,
tend energetic next day. course, know people
will immediately say, oh, well, sleep long, groggy next day. course
exceptions, general, sleep wakefulness homeostatic balance.
Thirst water consumption homeostatic balance. don't drink fluids
while, tend get thirsty, drink fluids thirst tends diminish
likewise food. Likewise, motivated behaviors. Well, one
important discoveries last century, largely work guy named Jaak
Panksepp. No, not Jack Jaak Panksepp really pioneered understanding
biology play relating psychology play animals humans.
considered kind luminary field play, great title have, right?


title scientific luminary, might well the, play
guy. fact known get later why, known
"Rat Tickler" tickled rats. actually found rodents animals
many kind generate laughter response tickling. fact, don't
capacity tickle something also talk is.
called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,
appropriate devices, able colleagues isolate so-called "Rat
Laughter" turns kitten laughter puppy laughter.
course human laughter. Jaak Panksepp interesting pioneering
person field. also discovered play homeostatically regulated.
Meaning animals including children restricted playing certain amount
time, will play given opportunity way food restrict
long period time, eat finally allowed eat. Now
important moves thing call play dimension
higher order functions things evolved recently, know, really kind

that, happens. Well prefrontal cortex often seen kind rigid
executive whole brain. one way view it, probably better way view
prefrontal cortex works concert primitive

play, prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid. actually gets smarter. develops
ability take different roles explore different contingencies. going
talk role play later different contexts. will find much
play really exploring things way feels safe enough explore, right?
not happens drive street bike
street, headed work, commuting bicycle walking driving,

kid, that. like jump off curb cuts kid.
eventually graduated, sorry cyclist, graduated skateboarding.
look skateboarding. always kind exploring terrain, know, got

child psychology, somewhat famous poem written research child
psychologist. name Burton White, wrote poem called "The Toddlers
Creed" "The Toddlers Creed" defines well, rules contingencies play
young children. reveals us just narrow limited world view
self entered world is. "The Toddlers Creed" read quickly, cuz' don't
want take much time is. "If want it. mine. give
change mind later, mine." anyone played toddler, can
imagine mind. "If can take away you, mine. little
ago, mine. building something together, pieces mine. looks
just like mine, mine. mine, will never belong anyone else, no matter what."
course, hear sounds quite awful, right? yet actually
reflection healthy toddler think world. objects
things, even people world theirs, actually possessions
belong them. Now course, people never actually transition beyond
stage moral social development. indeed adults fit "The
Toddlers Creed." welcome share them. ever think


might benefit self-reflection. seriousness Burton White's "Toddlers

will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood

not just fun. Play testing. experimenting

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money

However, hyper focused something rigidly attached

ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive

over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal

come across bunch papers say brain area connects brain area,
controls play animals. similar areas babies adults.


indeed, true. will talk brain circuitry, think importantly
understand utility play? know, play younger?
tend play less get older? world play for?
us categorized playful. sure know, people like this, maybe
like people can walk room, social setting kind,
seem already kind playful, maybe even mischievous quality them.
talk mischief little bit later, sort look environment
social setting opportunity different kinds novel interactions. people
probably put category. walk novel environment, tend

spontaneously playful person, although around certain individuals, might
spontaneously playful. continuum kind seriousness playful
nature. Turns young animals, including humans playfulness
tend engage spontaneous play earlier years later years.
therein lies interesting portal understanding utility,
purpose play is. First all, want lay couple key facts play
point fact play not just games. Play much, much
play particular, played child still can play adults
really test expand potential roles kinds interactions. One
important, interesting surprising features play like everyone know
homeostatically regulated. familiar term
homeostasis. Homeostasis just aspect biological systems try remain
balance. know, stay awake long period time, tend want sleep
long period time. slept long period time rested,
tend energetic next day. course, know people

exceptions, general, sleep wakefulness homeostatic balance.
Thirst water consumption homeostatic balance. don't drink fluids
while, tend get thirsty, drink fluids thirst tends diminish
likewise food. Likewise, motivated behaviors. Well, one
important discoveries last century, largely work guy named Jaak
Panksepp. No, not Jack Jaak Panksepp really pioneered understanding
biology play relating psychology play animals humans.
considered kind luminary field play, great title have, right?


title scientific luminary, might well the, play
guy. fact known get later why, known
"Rat Tickler" tickled rats. actually found rodents animals
many kind generate laughter response tickling. fact, don't
capacity tickle something also talk is.
called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,
appropriate devices, able colleagues isolate so-called "Rat
Laughter" turns kitten laughter puppy laughter.
course human laughter. Jaak Panksepp interesting pioneering
person field. also discovered play homeostatically regulated.
Meaning animals including children restricted playing certain amount
time, will play given opportunity way food restrict
long period time, eat finally allowed eat. Now
important moves thing call play dimension
higher order functions things evolved recently, know, really kind
front edge human evolution, deeper circuitry brain, whereby say
brain stem, kind ancient parts brain going involved. fact,
case going learn later podcast, play generated
connectivity many brain areas. one key brain areas area called PAG
Periaqueductal Gray. Periaqueductal Gray brain stem area. pretty far
back brain kind transitions spinal cord. rich neurons
make endogenous opioids. not kinds opioids causing
opioid crisis. neurons release endogenous,
meaning self-made biologically made opioids. go names like enkephalin
things sort. Play evokes small amounts opioid release system.
kind dope little bit, not much one see one take
exogenous opioids. fact exogenous opioids now know, potentially
hazardous, highly high addiction potential high overdose potential. cause sorts

nowadays, endogenous opioids released children adults anytime


engage play. turns important chemical state
something abundance endogenous opioids released
brain allows areas brain, like prefrontal cortex, area
front responsible call executive function. Executive function
ability make predictions, assess contingencies. Like this, happens.
that, happens. Well prefrontal cortex often seen kind rigid
executive whole brain. one way view it, probably better way view
prefrontal cortex works concert primitive
circuitries. periaqueductal gray releases endogenous opioids
play, prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid. actually gets smarter. develops
ability take different roles explore different contingencies. going
talk role play later different contexts. will find much
play really exploring things way feels safe enough explore, right?
not happens drive street bike
street, headed work, commuting bicycle walking driving,
tend linear tend goal directed. not going just take
new street just not going spontaneously riding middle
road sidewalk back forth. Although can remember
kid, that. like jump off curb cuts kid.
eventually graduated, sorry cyclist, graduated skateboarding.
look skateboarding. always kind exploring terrain, know, got
older, actually find becoming much linear. just don't play
commute much. really just getting work working.
endogenous opioids system, mode play, prefrontal

excuse me, Jaak Panksepp, "The rat tickler." also want just give nod play
generally, move forward discussion. love everyone
stop thinking play just child activity, not just sport related activity, really

00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought

incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal

well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

indeed, true. will talk brain circuitry, think importantly
understand utility play? know, play younger?
tend play less get older? world play for?
us categorized playful. sure know, people like this, maybe
like people can walk room, social setting kind,
seem already kind playful, maybe even mischievous quality them.
talk mischief little bit later, sort look environment
social setting opportunity different kinds novel interactions. people
probably put category. walk novel environment, tend
mode just assessing environment like. not particularly
spontaneously playful person, although around certain individuals, might
spontaneously playful. continuum kind seriousness playful
nature. Turns young animals, including humans playfulness
tend engage spontaneous play earlier years later years.
therein lies interesting portal understanding utility,
purpose play is. First all, want lay couple key facts play
point fact play not just games. Play much, much
play particular, played child still can play adults
really test expand potential roles kinds interactions. One
important, interesting surprising features play like everyone know
homeostatically regulated. familiar term
homeostasis. Homeostasis just aspect biological systems try remain
balance. know, stay awake long period time, tend want sleep
long period time. slept long period time rested,
tend energetic next day. course, know people
will immediately say, oh, well, sleep long, groggy next day. course
exceptions, general, sleep wakefulness homeostatic balance.
Thirst water consumption homeostatic balance. don't drink fluids
while, tend get thirsty, drink fluids thirst tends diminish
likewise food. Likewise, motivated behaviors. Well, one
important discoveries last century, largely work guy named Jaak
Panksepp. No, not Jack Jaak Panksepp really pioneered understanding
biology play relating psychology play animals humans.
considered kind luminary field play, great title have, right?


title scientific luminary, might well the, play
guy. fact known get later why, known
"Rat Tickler" tickled rats. actually found rodents animals
many kind generate laughter response tickling. fact, don't
capacity tickle something also talk is.
called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,
appropriate devices, able colleagues isolate so-called "Rat
Laughter" turns kitten laughter puppy laughter.
course human laughter. Jaak Panksepp interesting pioneering
person field. also discovered play homeostatically regulated.
Meaning animals including children restricted playing certain amount
time, will play given opportunity way food restrict
long period time, eat finally allowed eat. Now
important moves thing call play dimension
higher order functions things evolved recently, know, really kind
front edge human evolution, deeper circuitry brain, whereby say
brain stem, kind ancient parts brain going involved. fact,
case going learn later podcast, play generated
connectivity many brain areas. one key brain areas area called PAG
Periaqueductal Gray. Periaqueductal Gray brain stem area. pretty far
back brain kind transitions spinal cord. rich neurons
make endogenous opioids. not kinds opioids causing
opioid crisis. neurons release endogenous,
meaning self-made biologically made opioids. go names like enkephalin
things sort. Play evokes small amounts opioid release system.
kind dope little bit, not much one see one take
exogenous opioids. fact exogenous opioids now know, potentially
hazardous, highly high addiction potential high overdose potential. cause sorts
problems. Yes clinical uses them, causing lot problems
nowadays, endogenous opioids released children adults anytime


engage play. turns important chemical state
something abundance endogenous opioids released
brain allows areas brain, like prefrontal cortex, area
front responsible call executive function. Executive function
ability make predictions, assess contingencies. Like this, happens.
that, happens. Well prefrontal cortex often seen kind rigid
executive whole brain. one way view it, probably better way view
prefrontal cortex works concert primitive
circuitries. periaqueductal gray releases endogenous opioids
play, prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid. actually gets smarter. develops
ability take different roles explore different contingencies. going
talk role play later different contexts. will find much
play really exploring things way feels safe enough explore, right?
not happens drive street bike
street, headed work, commuting bicycle walking driving,
tend linear tend goal directed. not going just take
new street just not going spontaneously riding middle
road sidewalk back forth. Although can remember
kid, that. like jump off curb cuts kid.
eventually graduated, sorry cyclist, graduated skateboarding.
look skateboarding. always kind exploring terrain, know, got
older, actually find becoming much linear. just don't play
commute much. really just getting work working.
endogenous opioids system, mode play, prefrontal
cortex starts seeing exploring many possibilities interact
environment, others roles can assume ourselves.
going dissect one one, different aspects play, role play, social play, individual
play, imaginary play, competitive play enormous number dimensions play.
end episode, going arrive key feature. key
feature one called personal play identity. us call
personal play identity. personal play identity laid development.
identity assume playful scenarios. identity adopt
non playful scenarios. Now great news personal play identity plastic
throughout entire lifespan. can adjust personal play identity ways


will benefit work relationships overall level happiness. will
discuss protocols ways that. want give nod late jack, Jaak
excuse me, Jaak Panksepp, "The rat tickler." also want just give nod play
generally, move forward discussion. love everyone
stop thinking play just child activity, not just sport related activity, really
exploration contingencies. Again, exploration of, A, happens?
B, happens? someone else takes behavior attitude C
going do? play really can expand catalog potential outcomes,
can enormously enriching. indeed talk tinkerers
world, true creatives, people building incredible technologies art,
also just incredibly rich, emotional intellectual social lives
strong element play. today hope convince protocols will
allow expand

00:23:53 Childhood Play & Mindsets

various roles life, portal play. establish play
homeostatic, meaning need it. Many us, including myself, haven't played
much adults. pretty busy. Number us stressed. got lot
life, children, us engage lot play. looking way
young children especially toddlers play, can learn lot
reveals fundamental rules toddler brain interacts world. Now,
one key things baby brain baby brain somehow knows
can't everything world, right? baby needs something, generally will cry
make sort vocalization sort facial expression combination
those. caretaker, whoever may will provide it. ancient hard

calling autonomic discomfort autonomic dysregulation. not game,
rule. advance infant toddler, start think terms
relative world. now world
child psychology, somewhat famous poem written research child
psychologist. name Burton White, wrote poem called "The Toddlers
Creed" "The Toddlers Creed" defines well, rules contingencies play
young children. reveals us just narrow limited world view
self entered world is. "The Toddlers Creed" read quickly, cuz' don't
want take much time is. "If want it. mine. give
change mind later, mine." anyone played toddler, can
imagine mind. "If can take away you, mine. little
ago, mine. building something together, pieces mine. looks
just like mine, mine. mine, will never belong anyone else, no matter what."
course, hear sounds quite awful, right? yet actually
reflection healthy toddler think world. objects
things, even people world theirs, actually possessions
belong them. Now course, people never actually transition beyond
stage moral social development. indeed adults fit "The
Toddlers Creed." welcome share them. ever think


might benefit self-reflection. seriousness Burton White's "Toddlers
Creed" really grounded transition infants.
things delivered us, point toddlers can access things

00:32:17 (Power of) Playful Mindset

rather low stake scenarios. key theme here. continue,
just want point tool anyone can use, particular, less playful

engages spontaneous play. enjoy sports. enjoy exercise, distinct
play sports exercise engage in, take pretty seriously. not
low stakes me. put actually put lot importance them. saying
this, probably put little less importance little fun

prefrontal cortex. play powerful making prefrontal cortex plastic,
able change response experience, not just period play,
scenarios, get one prefrontal cortex, don't get prefrontal cortex
just play. get prefrontal cortex engages everything. going forward,
will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing

crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take

find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous

know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national

people continue evolve new practices tend people tinkerers.
People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards

playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance

keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular

learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different

recommendation make, certainly one going direct
well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

called "Rat tickler," discovered many species animals engage
laughter response tickling tickle other. reason don't hear
laughing, no can't hear dog laughing isn't laughing something else
animals besides humans laugh kind ultrasonic levels auditory output.
Meaning frequencies sound just high hear,

meaning self-made biologically made opioids. go names like enkephalin
things sort. Play evokes small amounts opioid release system.
kind dope little bit, not much one see one take
exogenous opioids. fact exogenous opioids now know, potentially
hazardous, highly high addiction potential high overdose potential. cause sorts

nowadays, endogenous opioids released children adults anytime


engage play. turns important chemical state
something abundance endogenous opioids released
brain allows areas brain, like prefrontal cortex, area

ability make predictions, assess contingencies. Like this, happens.
that, happens. Well prefrontal cortex often seen kind rigid
executive whole brain. one way view it, probably better way view
prefrontal cortex works concert primitive

will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid

set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number

make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different

can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,

endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,

However, hyper focused something rigidly attached

ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill

allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not

course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name

instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell

soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number

make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different

also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing

crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

However, hyper focused something rigidly attached

kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better

practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

imagine mind. "If can take away you, mine. little

course, hear sounds quite awful, right? yet actually

will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take

absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage

hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal

little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name

inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds

playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,

Now background science quite extensive,

Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors

scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous

needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money

ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill

adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

play trivial things. generally don't buy game. generally don't play
mostly end winning taking whatever have.

enough, play simply sake playing, something learn
people group one's self one reacts
things like someone clearly trying take everybody's money somebody

scenarios, get one prefrontal cortex, don't get prefrontal cortex
just play. get prefrontal cortex engages everything. going forward,
will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts
ways no one thought previously. course skateboarders
well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play
call serious endeavor one's occupation sport, whether not
behind desk whether not running around field really
engineering, endeavor. whole purpose episode play yes
one hand illustrate incredible evolutionary utility play setting self
relation self others, indeed setting cultures entirely, cuz' cultures will
watch sport together celebrate team winning. mean, World Cup,
never big soccer fan, even though dad Argentine, incredible. mean
entire world kind lights gets engaged around whether not team,
country going win Olympics also another example, play sport
not quite pointed before. us thinking
tools things can extract science enrich lives, say
already playing regular basis one form another terrific


start expand forms play particular forms play involve new groups
individuals. somebody typically plays one-on-one somebody, try
expand playing teams. somebody plays alone, try
expand playing perhaps one-on-one first groups,

01:00:03 Play Portal Neuroplasticity

establishing broader foundation practices can learn things within

anecdote explanation adopting stance playfulness indeed engaging


play somewhat regular basis beneficial regardless circumstances
goals. haven't done already, tell you, hopefully will push
line. turns look across kingdom animals,
find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous
system's ability change response experience, put differently, animals
play small fraction entire life rigid brains don't learn new

focus people pay attention doing, not,
know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national
security, playing pranks like that. actually Caltech, don't know still

People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs

focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep

deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging

something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

rest life, unless game particular type sport instance.
talk sport later. key theme play contingency testing. play
contingency testing conditions stakes sufficiently low,
individuals feel comfortable assuming different roles, even roles not
entirely comfortable within outside life. relates release
endogenous opioids, brain center periaqueductal gray way
allows prefrontal cortex direct way mean, truly allows biological
way expand number operations can run, start thinking about, oh,
well, okay. Normally kind loner like read work know, hang
alone maybe play alone know okay, play board game game
tennis partner going play partners two
people. Okay, little uncomfortable, it. that, discover
certain ways proficient certain ways, less proficient,
discover person actually tends cheat little bit person
extremely rigid rules, maybe extremely rigid way
organize pieces board, crossing line side tennis
court. sorts things learn

00:32:17 (Power of) Playful Mindset

rather low stake scenarios. key theme here. continue,
just want point tool anyone can use, particular, less playful
group. put category. Again, not somebody really
engages spontaneous play. enjoy sports. enjoy exercise, distinct
play sports exercise engage in, take pretty seriously. not
low stakes me. put actually put lot importance them. saying
this, probably put little less importance little fun
those. yet tell anyone everyone can benefit
engaging bit playful mindset, playful mindset not necessarily
smiling jumping around silly. not all. not Tigger
character "Winnie Pooh" necessarily. be, really allowing
expand number outcomes willing entertain think
relate different outcomes. means putting
scenarios might not top performer, right? Playing game


not really good at. experience recently, friends like play
cards, like low stake gambling. non illegal gambling ring.
play trivial things. generally don't buy game. generally don't play
mostly end winning taking whatever have.
mode assuming playful spirit, idea well, stakes low
enough, play simply sake playing, something learn
people group one's self one reacts
things like someone clearly trying take everybody's money somebody
clearly trying cheat somebody clearly very, rigid every last detail,
including cards dealt shuffled right? learning exploration.
biological level, prefrontal Cortex, starting entertain different
possibilities, starting entertain different outcomes low stakes way.
think it, not something allow often. Even
listen new forms music go see new art new movies, new
experiences, not us making new predictions going happen
next. not brain working figure new possibilities. can
immediately see just small increase willingness put
conditions don't understand rules perhaps, not super
proficient something, enter low stakes.
information learn others start open prefrontal
cortex circuits. say open up, don't mean literally opening
skull. mean prefrontal cortex can work rigid ways.
Meaning B, go street turn left go way work, fast.
go street, slow. traffic jam there, going go
starting explore different possibilities. very, opportunities
life explore contingencies low stakes way, engages neuroplasticity,
prefrontal cortex. play powerful making prefrontal cortex plastic,
able change response experience, not just period play,
scenarios, get one prefrontal cortex, don't get prefrontal cortex
just play. get prefrontal cortex engages everything. going forward,
will layer concrete aspects tools, now, somebody
doesn't consider yourself, particularly playful consider, maybe even engage just
little bit play way, discomfort



00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great

find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous

not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor

People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional

people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint

playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.

highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter

didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,

exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment

play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach

engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,

can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access

kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

play can change brain better. true every stage life.
recommendation make, certainly one going direct
well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

00:36:13 Body Postures

understanding increasing prefrontal cortical plasticity. Another really
interesting important aspect play so-called play postures. seen
animals, seen humans. watching
podcast YouTube, best adopt here.
listening, just imagine mind's eye, Jaak Panksepp
indeed Darwin himself, study play postures animal engage in. Perhaps
familiar one seen dogs wolves will lower head
ground put paws front will make eye contact
another typically dog wolf so-called call play. Now, posture,
obvious lowering themselves. not aggressive stance,
lowering head. universally known among canines
play posture. famous videos online. can look dogs
actually bears confronted bears, least
videos exchange also lowering head, see bear dog playful
interactions. Now always cautious bears general. say
cautious bears, speaks universality bowing, sort
the, the, people call puppy bow play bow dogs turns
humans well. Although different form, sure go
the, down-dog play posture, typically humans want play,
will subtle not subtle head tilt. head tilt eyes open considered
universal head facial expression posture play humans. two people
see one another, aggressive towards one another, will assume certain
facial expressions postures. feeling playful towards one another,
oftentimes tip head side just little bit open eyes.
might even raise eyebrows briefly. seen again.
Another hardwired feature so-called play postures called soft eyes.
animals aggressive, sad, tend reduce size eye
openings basically making eyelids closer together, somewhat, keeping
eyes together particular aggression, bring eyes towards call
vergence eye movement. Bring towards center actually narrows aperture
visual field. people animals want engage play, tend open
eyelids somewhat, tend purse lips just little bit. not like


stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts
ways no one thought previously. course skateboarders
well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play
call serious endeavor one's occupation sport, whether not
behind desk whether not running around field really
engineering, endeavor. whole purpose episode play yes
one hand illustrate incredible evolutionary utility play setting self
relation self others, indeed setting cultures entirely, cuz' cultures will
watch sport together celebrate team winning. mean, World Cup,
never big soccer fan, even though dad Argentine, incredible. mean
entire world kind lights gets engaged around whether not team,
country going win Olympics also another example, play sport
not quite pointed before. us thinking
tools things can extract science enrich lives, say
already playing regular basis one form another terrific


start expand forms play particular forms play involve new groups
individuals. somebody typically plays one-on-one somebody, try
expand playing teams. somebody plays alone, try
expand playing perhaps one-on-one first groups,

01:00:03 Play Portal Neuroplasticity

way brain learns evolves changes gets better.
raised another one top 10 questions get can keep brain
young? can continue learn? can get better school sport life
relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively, on. yes,
supplements can support neuroplasticity. Yes, brain games apps
can support neuroplasticity. really want engage neuroplasticity

establishing broader foundation practices can learn things within

anecdote explanation adopting stance playfulness indeed engaging


play somewhat regular basis beneficial regardless circumstances
goals. haven't done already, tell you, hopefully will push
line. turns look across kingdom animals,
find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous
system's ability change response experience, put differently, animals
play small fraction entire life rigid brains don't learn new

not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national

everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs

about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep

deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.
went Smithsonian. got see the, old fighter planes. think, think

this, know, 39 years, whenever again, forget exactly old was.
key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing

01:32:52 Personal Play Identity

bring forward world. context adults. illustrate this, going
ask question, child, say 10 years old,
considered competitive? considered somebody
cooperative? realize course not mutually exclusive,
competitive cooperative. consider somebody preferred

really enjoyed playing large groups? key one. somebody
enjoyed playing leader one moment equally okay follower
later moment? okay role switched midway

play can change brain better. true every stage life.
recommendation make, certainly one going direct
well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

stronger pursing lips like this, it's, pursing lips. open eyes
little bit. often head tilt well. Sometimes little bit smile.
reflexive not trained up. Children this. Adults dogs,
wolves this. Even certain birds will this. birds eyes side
heads, sort form soft eyes approach. certainly raptors,
see softening eyes indeed raptors like Hawks Eagles actually
certain form play, early life. thing see play,
called partial postures, partial postures kind play enactment
postures otherwise threatening. partial posture see
play animals humans relates aggressive play. things like wrestling
things like rough tumble play, common animals kids
adults. going physical interaction animals, will
happen will march toward one another often slowly, rather
hair up, call piloerection, hair goes up, animals
make look bigger. Think the, cat. trying look
bigger animal aggressive, trying look bigger presence
foe, different animal either going try kill fight way, even
defend themselves, partial postures occur animals will approach one
another, keep fur down. Humans will to, will approach
play, unless highly competitive play like football game boxing match,
will actually shrink body size somewhat. hair bodies, us
others, hair capable piloerection. can stand up. hair
standing end phenomenon, us don't enough hair bodies
can actually use make larger. see people
engage play tend make body little bit smaller unless
highly competitive highly competitive play distinct form play.
talk later, sport, stakes high, Super Bowl
football game, revealing ignorance sports here. Super Bowl
typically called high stakes game, right? Salaries depend it. Sponsorships
depend it. television, reputations depend it. not really playing
game. playing high stakes game not going see
partial postures. not going see soft eyes tilting head. least not
opposing players team, going see quite opposite.
Grunting, screaming, shouldering people not blinking lowering eyes, rather


shrinking eyes be, appear aggressive. kinds things
staring right person, know verbal threats et cetera. not
really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts

well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play
call serious endeavor one's occupation sport, whether not
behind desk whether not running around field really
engineering, endeavor. whole purpose episode play yes
one hand illustrate incredible evolutionary utility play setting self
relation self others, indeed setting cultures entirely, cuz' cultures will
watch sport together celebrate team winning. mean, World Cup,
never big soccer fan, even though dad Argentine, incredible. mean
entire world kind lights gets engaged around whether not team,
country going win Olympics also another example, play sport
not quite pointed before. us thinking
tools things can extract science enrich lives, say
already playing regular basis one form another terrific


start expand forms play particular forms play involve new groups
individuals. somebody typically plays one-on-one somebody, try
expand playing teams. somebody plays alone, try

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool

deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural

coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported

play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,

exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

really play, even though say playing game football, high stakes
play. referring fairly low stakes. see
animals human. many, many partial postures. Again,
happen spontaneously. someone ever looks tilt head little bit
raise eyebrows maybe smile little bit, looking
playfully, universal human exchange of, want play. want play?
another play expression considered extreme come
play express postures. one seen lot primates indeed
humans well. eyes wide open believe not tongue out,
the, kind silly thing. don't think ever done before. Just
kind thing basically primate species kinds. indeed old world
primates well, want say, definitely play
here. Okay kind silly look connotation. watch chimpanzees
look Bonobos, even so-called new world monkeys, tend
smaller monkeys, old world monkeys tend ones general, see
world do, call trichromacy. ones often can look
human-like. new world monkeys tend little ones general give
little trick here. Little tool based primatology. see monkey making
slow movements, see ape kinds, making slow movements,
likely old world primate. see monkey it's, can quick
movements like kind thing, like like squirrel monkey
marmoset, likely new world monkey. don't see world
way do, see world like dog. don't really see reds.
see reds orange et cetera. Okay not hard fast rule. sure
primatologists going come whatever primatologists come
monkey biscuits something like that. general, good rule.
zoo see slow moving monkey slow deliberate gestures kind moves
eyes makes eye contact every while, tend old world
primates, kind jittery ones look like really nervous wrapping tail
kind hiding little bundle. tend new world monkeys,
okay.



00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking

Again, not black white type division, that'll get way.
whole purpose partial postures tongue thing limit power
deliberate ways really take bodily expressions portrayed
interpreted aggressive threatening wanting mate, willing wanting
anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts

Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks

everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool

however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work

Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported

adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected

make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion

extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open

anything matter. limit power expressed
deliberate way. putting hair down, despite getting fighting
stance. saying fight, not really fight fight. low stakes
fighting. Like pin you, let go. pin me, let go.
immediately can start see play starts call action, social
dynamics parties make sort agreement high
stakes are. Now, failures also informative develop
social groups. also can inform people really play well others
people don't. people seem get along well groups can
handle people. people rigid. fact, anecdote
kid, used play game. not game suggest, used
called "Dirt Clod Wars." friend mine, parents generally
not home afternoon. must somewhere around 10 11 years
old. set two big dirt mounds. shovel big dirt
mounds two sides yard. just take dirt clods throw
one another just dirt clod wars. Again, not suggesting not
responsible happens do, rules rules were,
instance, couldn't pack rocks dirt clods run across
side jump person's mound throw dirt clods
there. guess, stuff thought entertaining. someone got hit
head, generally unspoken rule kind stop see whether not
damaged not continue, couldn't continue pelting them.
course, people broke rule. fact remember one kid not going name
actually grown actually prominent functional adult,
got hit head. think someone thrown dirt clod shortly
thereafter, sudden just went rage, picking rocks sticks
attacking another kid. clearly case rules game
now violated, served important purpose. was, know,


typical thing the, tears think, recall one kid
other, like snot coming nose turning bright red, kid went
home. mess. parents say something, maybe phone
call. don't quite recall got resolved. idea agreed upon
set rules high stakes going do.
separate sport clearly defined rules bounds.
in-bounds. sorts behaviors will get yellow card red card
instance soccer field, animals including humans low stakes
contingency testing animals including humans find, start stakes.
inevitably group play, one member group will kind break rules. see
also puppies. instance, puppies will bite one another sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth. remember Costello teeth, things
darn sharp puppies will yelp one littermates bites them, Yelp
actually serves important inhibitory function. well defined tell
one tough, animals learn soft bite. Okay. don't get
feedback littermates, never actually learn. hard
soft. humans well. Now can look adult, counterparts,
indeed probably look ask, know learn proper play
contingency younger? tend take things seriously?
tend overreact aggressively people clearly engaging in, know,
playful, jabbing sarcasm things sort. will different
experience this, point play serves many functions, not just
self. also interactions multiple people. rule testing low
stakes contingency rule breaking also serves important role

00:48:24 Role Play

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world
roles order instance, establish hierarchies. someone's going leader
someone's going follower. Someone will dominant. Someone will
submissive. Someone will work alone. people will work group. kinds


role playing ways prefrontal cortex expand number
operations neuroscience call algorithms run order make
predictions. take lot information environment time
make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different
dimensions play really testing feel comfortable
uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different

also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction

Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks

everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind

Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response

use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural

coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported

almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit

really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma

good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,

exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open

example "Dirt Clod War" puppies biting puppies et cetera.
last not least, different forms play help us establish will
become adults. One powerful role play children
sometimes adults will take different roles distinct natural world

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,

also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money

ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole

make predictions. suddenly cast new role, well
definitely make even predictions different standpoint.
powerful teaching brain, function. sister growing up, still
sister, fortunately, friends largely played dolls doll
houses room next door. take different roles. fact, kids,
play alone will start take role leader taking imaginary creating
imaginary friend. And, know, apologies sibling, long time,
imaginary friend eventually imaginary friend disappeared. don't know
science around imaginary friends makes disappear not stage
development, imaginary friends pretty common. just another way
able to, know boss somebody around, thing, engage
cooperative play. can look stage development, call childhood
can look stage can say, wow, different

uncomfortable, react good bad, react stress glee
others behave certain ways. hoping coming play
not just fun. Play testing. experimenting
expanding brain's capacity.

00:50:39 Neurobiology Low-stakes Play

early development, throughout lifespan.
point discussion, want take step back, look biology
neurochemistry play just little bit. really define effective play.
goal play explore different contingencies low stakes environments
expand function prefrontal cortex can see new possibilities new
ways become flexible, creative, effective outside games
play arenas play, say. Well asking, know
playing? know playing correctly? Turns answer
that. Earlier referred brain area, periaqueductal gray releases opioids,
endogenous opioids brain body, tends relax us bit. actually


leads things like soft eyes head tilts puppies making, know,
puppy postures things sort, opens number different
functions algorithms prefrontal cortex can run, another piece
puzzle, something genuinely play playful,
effect expanding brain engaging neuroplasticity really changing brain
can see engaging possible behaviors thoughts et cetera.
also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money
table given game, football player Super Bowl, playing
game which, know, defeating person team winning absolutely
crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way
simply explore, don't high levels adrenaline
system,

00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities Tinkering



not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts

well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play
call serious endeavor one's occupation sport, whether not

engineering, endeavor. whole purpose episode play yes
one hand illustrate incredible evolutionary utility play setting self
relation self others, indeed setting cultures entirely, cuz' cultures will
watch sport together celebrate team winning. mean, World Cup,
never big soccer fan, even though dad Argentine, incredible. mean
entire world kind lights gets engaged around whether not team,
country going win Olympics also another example, play sport
not quite pointed before. us thinking
tools things can extract science enrich lives, say
already playing regular basis one form another terrific


start expand forms play particular forms play involve new groups
individuals. somebody typically plays one-on-one somebody, try
expand playing teams. somebody plays alone, try

establishing broader foundation practices can learn things within
context. Thus far tried convince combination data
anecdote explanation adopting stance playfulness indeed engaging


play somewhat regular basis beneficial regardless circumstances
goals. haven't done already, tell you, hopefully will push
line. turns look across kingdom animals,
find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous
system's ability change response experience, put differently, animals
play small fraction entire life rigid brains don't learn new
things, whereas animals play long period throughout life plastic
brains. even evidence point, largely anecdotal,
data starting emerge adults maintain playful stance engage
things low stakes contingency exploring important enough people
focus people pay attention doing, not,
know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national
security, playing pranks like that. actually Caltech, don't know still
case, Caltech employed always known
technologically challenging pranks. not known athletic pros Caltech,
sorry, Caltech, known example, disrupting scoreboard Rose
Bowl Pasadena, instance, things sort technological feats,
least time required lot playfulness technological pros. look
science look art, look medicine domain, find
people continue evolve new practices tend people tinkerers.
People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.
went Smithsonian. got see the, old fighter planes. think, think

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different

reason children experience lot trauma stress limited plasticity
later neurochemical substrates created trauma

also low amounts adrenaline, called epinephrine brain body.
Now background science quite extensive,
interested papers manuscripts, perhaps best one review published
Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews Jaak Panksepp although
co-author, Stephen Siviy, S V Y provide link caption show
notes. title paper is; "In Search Neurobiological Substrates
Social Playfulness Mammalian Brains." quite extensive review,
basically boils key findings whereby, sorts drugs behaviors
scenarios increase levels adrenaline much, will tend inhibit play drugs
scenarios not suggesting recreational drugs here,
experiments done laboratory setting increase endogenous
opioid output will tend increase playfulness. really state mind one
needs adopt playing is, first engage play it, whatever
happens degree focus seriousness focus seriousness
neurobiological context generally means epinephrine able focus largely
reliant things like adrenaline epinephrine, also presence dopamine,
molecule generates motivation focus concert epinephrine, also
endogenous opioids liberated. really low stakes feature play
allows endogenous opioids liberated. mean that? Well,
very, concerned outcome, like put lot money

crucial you. Well not really going engage play circuitry.
contrary, engaging behaviors behavior way

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage

kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great

well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play

find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous

focus people pay attention doing, not,
know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national
security, playing pranks like that. actually Caltech, don't know still
case, Caltech employed always known
technologically challenging pranks. not known athletic pros Caltech,
sorry, Caltech, known example, disrupting scoreboard Rose

people continue evolve new practices tend people tinkerers.
People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs

about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep

deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different

make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion

not stressed potential outcome. Well, constitutes play. Now
somewhat obvious one hand take seriously take
seriously, can playful things don't take seriously,
absolutely not obvious state playfulness actually allows
perform best state playfulness offers opportunity engage
novel types behaviors interactions not otherwise able access
focused outcome. Okay. state playfulness absolutely
critical, not just play, competitive scenarios kind. actually
started cultivate practice related this. college, kind
general practice wanted learn something. tell
important information world interested it.
kind lie say oh, super interested in, won't name topics,
super interested super interested that. sort delude
hyper focused whatever learning ways surprised me.
However, hyper focused something rigidly attached
outcome, can't engage flexible thinking. great tool hyper-focused
something take very, seriously simply trying learn things
kind rote memory, learn things regurgitate, learn regurgitate sort that,
know, frankly lot schooling involves. trying get better
something, sort hit wall athletic performance cognitive performance,
not creative enough, finding just use sports example
that, know certain number moves can deploy certain
number swings racket can deploy. way actually expand
practice engage kind low stakes thinking, idea that, well, just going
kind play tinker. going explore way doesn't really matter
ball goes back net, doesn't really matter ball goes hole
counterintuitive think, no, thing need drill drill
drill drill. indeed place that. mode play modest
levels endogenous opioids released system, plus low levels
adrenaline, right? Epinephrine low levels epinephrine adrenaline possible
stakes low enough not stressed. Well combination really
allows prefrontal cortex explore different possibilities ways can truly expand
capabilities time. Now, seen again, also


business sector, challenging, say compare additive
companies get jobs interested hiring people children
called tinkerers, actually NASA first famous this, many people
achieved great success engineering NASA, looked back
childhood histories, people tended tinkerers. people
kind play things way wasn't rigidly following recipe instruction
manual. Great cooks discover new forms food. Indeed created entire genres food
way tinkerers. Okay, musicians this. grew playing various sports,
skateboarding one particularly involved long time. One
greatest skateboarders time may recognize name Great
Rodney Mullen. Rodney kind famous evolving sport continuing
evolve sport ways no one predict using skateboards sorts
ways no one thought previously. course skateboarders
well, particularly well known that. process own.
can't speak much, also known kind tinker somebody
spend lot time, just kind flipping board just flipping
air watching ways flipped kind studying physics really
expanding existing understanding happen skateboard
way just playing. Now, took seriously, kind razor's edge
taking something seriously, also tinkering playing exploring
just seeing happens kind like, well, just see happens
this, mindset extremely powerful export thing call play
call serious endeavor one's occupation sport, whether not
behind desk whether not running around field really
engineering, endeavor. whole purpose episode play yes
one hand illustrate incredible evolutionary utility play setting self
relation self others, indeed setting cultures entirely, cuz' cultures will
watch sport together celebrate team winning. mean, World Cup,
never big soccer fan, even though dad Argentine, incredible. mean
entire world kind lights gets engaged around whether not team,
country going win Olympics also another example, play sport
not quite pointed before. us thinking
tools things can extract science enrich lives, say
already playing regular basis one form another terrific


start expand forms play particular forms play involve new groups
individuals. somebody typically plays one-on-one somebody, try
expand playing teams. somebody plays alone, try
expand playing perhaps one-on-one first groups,

01:00:03 Play Portal Neuroplasticity

way brain learns evolves changes gets better.
raised another one top 10 questions get can keep brain
young? can continue learn? can get better school sport life
relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively, on. yes,
supplements can support neuroplasticity. Yes, brain games apps
can support neuroplasticity. really want engage neuroplasticity
age, need return sorts practices tools
nervous system naturally used throughout development. evolved hundreds
thousands years trigger thing call neuroplasticity. reason
important starts move us away people call hacks.
define hacks using one thing different purpose kind get shortcut. don't
really like term, frankly, don't like not grounded biological
mechanism. look play, can say, play portal plastic. Play
every stage life way learned rules stage life. play
way able test might function real world context.
play powerful. even say play powerful portal
plasticity. reason yes, high opioid, low epinephrine adrenaline
state opens play. inside arena play, prefrontal

degree focus, number chemicals deployed. Things like
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor growth factors actually trigger
rewiring brain circuits allow expand. indeed
neuroplasticity. interested chemicals kind arena things
happen one engages neuroplasticity, vast literature there. one
popular books think quite good friend colleague,
John Ratey, psychiatrist Harvard Medical School. R T E Y. wrote
book "Spark" years back, think still relevant. John talks


important role play exerts neuroplasticity process points
number different protocols one can engage in. also points importance
navigating new environments not just go hike every week, take
walk, actually get new novel environments. starting sense
theme here. novelty, exploring contingencies, keeping stakes relatively low,
et cetera, et cetera. really gates holy grail call
neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity talked podcast two step
process. involves focusing intensely least focusing somewhat whatever
one trying learn, engaging deep rest, ideally deep sleep
following nights. also talked benefits things like naps Yoga

focus rest. not learning something sake school critically
trying learn motor behavior sake sport. really expanding number
things learn line. Okay, said again. just want
make sure abundantly clear play establishing broader framework within

01:04:44 Adulthood Play

establishing broader foundation practices can learn things within
context. Thus far tried convince combination data
anecdote explanation adopting stance playfulness indeed engaging


play somewhat regular basis beneficial regardless circumstances
goals. haven't done already, tell you, hopefully will push
line. turns look across kingdom animals,
find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous
system's ability change response experience, put differently, animals
play small fraction entire life rigid brains don't learn new
things, whereas animals play long period throughout life plastic
brains. even evidence point, largely anecdotal,
data starting emerge adults maintain playful stance engage
things low stakes contingency exploring important enough people
focus people pay attention doing, not,
know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national
security, playing pranks like that. actually Caltech, don't know still
case, Caltech employed always known
technologically challenging pranks. not known athletic pros Caltech,
sorry, Caltech, known example, disrupting scoreboard Rose
Bowl Pasadena, instance, things sort technological feats,
least time required lot playfulness technological pros. look
science look art, look medicine domain, find
people continue evolve new practices tend people tinkerers.
People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.
went Smithsonian. got see the, old fighter planes. think, think
Kitty Hawk first one first planes there. Anyway, obviously
recollection isn't terrific. hippocampus is, flailing one, never forget
trip. never forget went. think probably eight nine years old.
embedded somewhere memory. just passive experience
focusing things excited trip, recollection
experience. didn't deliberately focus. didn't, wasn't telling focused,
going need remember trip someday going podcasting


this, know, 39 years, whenever again, forget exactly old was.
key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different
types emotional experiences relate sort scenario created
trauma. entire episode fear trauma, recommend
check episode. easy find hubermanlab.com, YouTube,
Apples, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera, easy find. talk trauma
treatments various kinds trauma treatments there, efficacy
different scenarios traumas on. point like make now
reason children experience lot trauma stress limited plasticity
later neurochemical substrates created trauma
stress, stress epinephrine epinephrine stress.
inseparable way less shuts least inhibits
suppresses play circuits. reassuring thing engaging
play adults, can reactivate circuits reopen plasticity. fact
one prominent trauma treatment now, especially people
subjected severe traumas, ongoing sense, meaning traumas went
many, many years get engage play things like dance basically
getting engage bodily movements ways otherwise not
feel comfortable engage in. find area interesting face
it, say, oh, kind of, know, really biomedical treatment?
know, taking people traumatized dance. mean, seems
kind silly one hand, depending your, know, particular orientation.


hand, actually quite profound quite grounded mechanisms
brain circuits change. again, back original principle,
play, isn't just one portal plasticity play fundamental portal plasticity
play dance exploration novel movements, exploration novel athletic
movements route access new ways thinking new contingencies.
find wonderful trauma release psychiatric psychology
community exploring things like play dance forms reopening
circuits indeed love magic pill trauma
erased new memories laid device that.
frankly, ask number colleagues, whether not likely
happen anytime soon effective way, think short answer going no,
going chemicals things can augment support process,
not going just magic pill will suddenly reverse trauma
altogether. always going case whereby shifts neurochemical states
going combined new ways thinking new behaviors.
find wonderful reassuring people looking play play behavior not
just one tiny shard possibility there, might actually main driver

01:23:25 Competition & Dynamic Movement

highly productive lever rewire traumatized brain. like
me, might thinking, okay, willing playful. willing explore, play
portal plasticity. makes good sense, play?
do? Well, already established want keep adrenaline low.
keep stakes slow enough not going get totally consumed
outcome. Now, people highly competitive, going
challenging. yet don't want make seem can't competitive
play. many forms competitive play competitive

necessarily just engage plasticity allows perform behavior, rather
expand number possibilities brain change general throughout life
two major forms good Peer Reviewed Research
engage novel forms movement, including different speeds movement.
say instance, somebody runs. happen like running. try run three
times week. generally run, run forward, don't run backward, although
recently, become excited work so-called "Knees

found beneficial back my, know, interior tibialis
things really helped posture forth. general,
run, run forward, don't tend run backward much. might
minutes end, not much throughout entire run. Running doesn't lend
lot novel forms movement, lateral movements. nerds

dance sports end generating lot dynamic movements
jumping, movement different angles, ducking,
leaping, basically involve lot dynamic movement. aren't just strictly

01:27:36 Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty

provided don't take seriously. don't get high levels epinephrine.
Now also interested non-physical non-athletic forms play
can really expand plasticity. interesting research game
Chess. don't play game Chess. played times. confess don't know
move pieces. not going try describe here,
always wanted learn Chess. think reading Peer Reviewed
Research chess play neuroplasticity, now understand
really nice paper published International Journal Research Education
Science 2017. title paper is, "Is Chess Just Game Mirror
Reflects Child's Inner World?" very, intense title biologist like
me, paper interesting really points fact
single game chess, least understand two players, two players
moving pieces chess board, piece can different things,
right? Can move different ways different scenarios, different rules
different pieces. player actually assume multiple identities
game. identities different rules ways interacting.
way can think chess one game, actually chess kind substrate
exploring multiple roles different characters. quite bit different
instance, video games somebody favorite video game player,
avatar. always role. also quite bit different
engage kind play yourself, just
game. now highly incentivized explore chess. see quotes there,
instance, things like "Chess life jiu jitsu life." always assumed meant
someone's entire life chess entire life jiu jitsu instance,
reading research chess particular, also certain forms martial
arts, also certain forms dance. one finds indeed games life
sense involve adopting multiple roles exploring contingencies


number different ways. games allow explore much
vaster landscape movements mental roles ways engaging strategic
movement case chess. hear that, know, activity
blank life. often reflects passion activity, think looked differently.
also reflects fact activity portal can explore life
many, many different lenses. think especially powerful terms
thinking play can leveraged plasticity.
interested leveraging play neuroplasticity expanding mind, will,
highly recommend picking activity will allow adopt different roles within
activity not rigidly linear. actually way start depart
modern important, somewhat narrow idea. exercise
route plasticity. Yes, true. Nobel Prize winning colleagues swim two
miles day done long time. will tell you, always think
clearly swimming certainly experience good run
good workout, mind seems work best. Unless course, workout very,
intense. talked before. work very, hard whether
not aerobic resistance training sport kind, brain won't function
well afterwards, mostly diversion oxygen tissues away
brain, actually getting less oxygen brain, general, us feel
exercise regularly, brain functions better. activities
extend beyond linear exercise, beyond just generating sets movements
again, not exercise not. really play is. Play
dynamically exploring different kinds movements, dynamically exploring
different kinds thoughts, dynamically exploring different kinds roles one
adopt. way brain learns new things. encourage
explore chess. intend learn chess year. excited that. Now,
already play chess expert chess player, actually will derive less
benefit terms play induced neuroplasticity would, instance,
went out, don't know, played game soccer something
novel nervous system, novelty exploration new
behaviors new ways thinking, opening portal plasticity, whereas
already know trying just perform better better it,
will get better chess, again, just chess. not expanding
realms can become plastic, able learn new things

play can change brain better. true every stage life.
recommendation make, certainly one going direct
well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought

involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,

Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national

People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards

playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.

key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported

play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,

make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open

bring forward world. context adults. illustrate this, going
ask question, child, say 10 years old,
considered competitive? considered somebody
cooperative? realize course not mutually exclusive,
competitive cooperative. consider somebody preferred
play alone preferred play one two close friends? somebody
really enjoyed playing large groups? key one. somebody
enjoyed playing leader one moment equally okay follower

01:40:55 Recommendations Play

play can change brain better. true every stage life.
recommendation make, certainly one going direct
well try engage least one hour pure play per week. Now came
recommendation literature says, well, need engage
something pretty repetitively. novel. wouldn't something
exceptionally good already. insist something already
exceptionally good at, want really free form, low stakes tinkering.


make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion
beginner's mind, sort like, know beginner's mind? think
beginner's mind sort expectation not going well yet, play
extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open
neuroplasticity. need little guidance play.

Away: Workaholic's Cure Anxiety." focused anxiety. author
Charlie Hoehn, last name H O E H N will provide link show notes
caption, "Play Away: Workaholic's Cure Anxiety." books resources
aside, think one hour play per week reasonable amount time engage
dedicated play behavior. purpose opening neural circuits
plasticity, key feature course, not immense proficiency given
activity, least not way perform it. gain proficiency
activity, well, becomes something else no longer play performance.
case, want adopt new play behavior. notice
largely avoided using word fun throughout episode. Fun somewhat abstract
term like many emotions many verbal descriptions experience. falls short
context neurobiologic goal discussion play. fun, terrific.
people might find, however engaging play kind uncomfortable. Well there,
goal lower level discomfort focusing less
outcomes just simply engaging behavior because, well, telling
good you, hopefully will tell good will
experience good you. literature certainly points that. literature
certainly points fact play way built. built play.
brain circuits back front within body play

play somewhat regular basis beneficial regardless circumstances
goals. haven't done already, tell you, hopefully will push
line. turns look across kingdom animals,
find animals engage playful behaviors longest period time
also animals greatest degree neuroplasticity, brain nervous
system's ability change response experience, put differently, animals
play small fraction entire life rigid brains don't learn new
things, whereas animals play long period throughout life plastic
brains. even evidence point, largely anecdotal,
data starting emerge adults maintain playful stance engage
things low stakes contingency exploring important enough people
focus people pay attention doing, not,
know, filled adrenaline, know, freaked outcome B,
not super, super competitive, maybe just little bit competitive not competitive
all. allows ongoing plasticity. one people comes mind
thinking course Physicist, say Great Physicist,
Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner Professor Caltech involved
Manhattan Project, also known lifelong tinker, right? also
mischievous tinker. read books Feynman Feynman "Surely
Joking." Mr. Feynman, "What Care People Think?"
wonderful short stories, mostly Feynman, things like picking locks
Los Alamos Laboratory putting top secret documents floor
office people came men morning, there.
Obviously weren't released general public. didn't want threaten national
security, playing pranks like that. actually Caltech, don't know still
case, Caltech employed always known
technologically challenging pranks. not known athletic pros Caltech,
sorry, Caltech, known example, disrupting scoreboard Rose
Bowl Pasadena, instance, things sort technological feats,
least time required lot playfulness technological pros. look
science look art, look medicine domain, find
people continue evolve new practices tend people tinkerers.
People creative, tend people unafraid exploring things a,
low stakes way. not rigidly attached outcome


everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.
went Smithsonian. got see the, old fighter planes. think, think
Kitty Hawk first one first planes there. Anyway, obviously
recollection isn't terrific. hippocampus is, flailing one, never forget
trip. never forget went. think probably eight nine years old.
embedded somewhere memory. just passive experience
focusing things excited trip, recollection
experience. didn't deliberately focus. didn't, wasn't telling focused,
going need remember trip someday going podcasting


this, know, 39 years, whenever again, forget exactly old was.
key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

make safe, make free form. really explore things that. people
call beginner's mind. Although find little abstract, like notion

everything perfectly time. Now might cloak playful behaviors
final works always look perfect always look incredible, kind
playful nature them. venture even say the, street artist Banksy,
instance, obviously incredible artist puts ton thought preparation
work, kind playfulness whole thing too, using two dimensional
paintings concert three dimensional city dwellings ways that, know think
people hadn't previously, people like Christo and, know,
artists sort that. think Banksy kind recognized modern,
modern rendition kind playfulness using cities ways people
don't use cities using art ways people don't use art, instance. go
back example Feynman. Feynman somebody learned paint
draw quite well sixties. somewhat famous infamous, say
Bongo Drumming roof Caltech. say infamous known also
naked. Something certainly not concert ethical standards
behaviors universities today. Feynman playful spirit child.
playful spirit teenager, playful spirit adult. one
whole hallmarks Feynman wasn't just rigid physicist
explain things clearly general public. always carried playful spirit
writings, pointed fact playful spirit something
worked hard continue cultivate way
see world differently indeed make great discoveries field
physics, also kind evolve relationship life generally.
comes mind prominent example somebody this. achieve
anything episode, besides teaching something biology play,
teach utility play. Again, I'm, don't consider
particularly playful person nature, tried years adopt stance
exploring things are, know, focused contingencies different kinds,
keep stakes low enough

01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together

can fun them. like think benefited somewhat.
Now, like drill little bit thing called neuroplasticity.
neuroplasticity brain nervous system's ability change response


experience. just say throughout entire lifespan, nervous system
can change quickly response negative experiences. can almost engage
called one trial learning something really terrible traumatic happens
us, nervous system will rewire almost immediately, least within days,
tend want avoid experience led trauma. Now whole
business people return things traumatic whole issue.
books things like trauma bonding. so-called repetition
compulsion psychoanalysis people go back trauma retest gain new
opportunities overcome trauma, et cetera, et cetera. general,
referring is, know, bad experience swimming pool
kid someone holds head underwater long, just
don't want get back water. one trial learning sorts, course can
overcomed proper exposure therapy someone trust taking
there, number behaviors allow overcome that, particular
scenario experience something new context. across lifespan,
learn earning new things, new contingencies, new possibilities occurs
differently age zero born age 25 thereafter.
about, about, want emphasize approximately age 25 onward neuroplasticity
occurs process exactly described before, focus, rest, focus, rest,
focus intensely. can't thing. can't new movement. can't
golf swing. can't learn math. try, try, try, try, sleep
nights. sudden can it, right, rewiring actually occurs
deep rest naps, mostly deep sleep. birth till age 25
however, can learn things, new things, new contingencies, not just negative
things traumatic things somewhat passive exposure things, right.
will never forget first time went family trip Washington DC.
went Smithsonian. got see the, old fighter planes. think, think
Kitty Hawk first one first planes there. Anyway, obviously
recollection isn't terrific. hippocampus is, flailing one, never forget
trip. never forget went. think probably eight nine years old.
embedded somewhere memory. just passive experience
focusing things excited trip, recollection
experience. didn't deliberately focus. didn't, wasn't telling focused,
going need remember trip someday going podcasting


this, know, 39 years, whenever again, forget exactly old was.
key feature developing brain able learn passive
experience neurons, nerve cells developing brain much
over-connected will later life. way think sort of,
use Google maps, often think drive, number roads
pathways get point point B. imagine neural
circuits, imagine neural circuits roads. Early development,
nerve connections much extensive. like Google maps
everything connected everything tiny little cross streets. whole
thing just complete mess. taking particular routes behavior thought
emotion, certain routes become well established. routes not
taken simply disappear. Now biological context brain, call process
pruning. simple way envision early development. many,
many neurons will adult. neurons extensively
interconnected, approximately 40% interconnections will disappear
time 25 years old, gone. actively removed processes
involve things like glial cells come literally sneak little processes
neurons synapse, points contact communication
neurons push apart, even eat neurons, right?
incredible work instance, Beth Stevens' Lab Harvard Medical School, showing
glial cells go eat synapses not functional particular circuit.
Now, tells us much learning development removal
incorrect connections, also involves strengthening connections
going serve certain emotions, certain functions, motor functions, cognitive functions,
et cetera. process play largely process engaging pruning neural
connections strengthening remaining connections. sure many
heard term fire together wire together. phrase often incorrectly
attributed great Donald Hebb, indeed great. incredible work
psychologist Canada established lot basic cellar learning rules
learning memory, also great Dr. Carla Shatz, now Stanford
Berkeley Harvard well, Stanford Medical School
coined term fire together wire together. Indeed happens children
play adolescents play young adults play, whether not social play
play object, whether not sport play kind imaginary play


imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different
types emotional experiences relate sort scenario created
trauma. entire episode fear trauma, recommend
check episode. easy find hubermanlab.com, YouTube,
Apples, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera, easy find. talk trauma
treatments various kinds trauma treatments there, efficacy
different scenarios traumas on. point like make now
reason children experience lot trauma stress limited plasticity
later neurochemical substrates created trauma
stress, stress epinephrine epinephrine stress.
inseparable way less shuts least inhibits
suppresses play circuits. reassuring thing engaging
play adults, can reactivate circuits reopen plasticity. fact
one prominent trauma treatment now, especially people
subjected severe traumas, ongoing sense, meaning traumas went
many, many years get engage play things like dance basically
getting engage bodily movements ways otherwise not
feel comfortable engage in. find area interesting face
it, say, oh, kind of, know, really biomedical treatment?
know, taking people traumatized dance. mean, seems
kind silly one hand, depending your, know, particular orientation.


hand, actually quite profound quite grounded mechanisms
brain circuits change. again, back original principle,
play, isn't just one portal plasticity play fundamental portal plasticity
play dance exploration novel movements, exploration novel athletic
movements route access new ways thinking new contingencies.
find wonderful trauma release psychiatric psychology
community exploring things like play dance forms reopening
circuits indeed love magic pill trauma
erased new memories laid device that.
frankly, ask number colleagues, whether not likely
happen anytime soon effective way, think short answer going no,
going chemicals things can augment support process,
not going just magic pill will suddenly reverse trauma
altogether. always going case whereby shifts neurochemical states
going combined new ways thinking new behaviors.
find wonderful reassuring people looking play play behavior not
just one tiny shard possibility there, might actually main driver

01:23:25 Competition & Dynamic Movement

highly productive lever rewire traumatized brain. like
me, might thinking, okay, willing playful. willing explore, play
portal plasticity. makes good sense, play?
do? Well, already established want keep adrenaline low.
keep stakes slow enough not going get totally consumed
outcome. Now, people highly competitive, going
challenging. yet don't want make seem can't competitive
play. many forms competitive play competitive

neuroplasticity. particular forms play again, not designed
necessarily just engage plasticity allows perform behavior, rather
expand number possibilities brain change general throughout life
two major forms good Peer Reviewed Research
engage novel forms movement, including different speeds movement.
say instance, somebody runs. happen like running. try run three
times week. generally run, run forward, don't run backward, although
recently, become excited work so-called "Knees
Toes Guy," name Ben Parker, goes "Knees Toes Guy"
Instagram. never met him, exchanged messages back forth.
practices involve walking backwards sled poles backwards.
found beneficial back my, know, interior tibialis
things really helped posture forth. general,
run, run forward, don't tend run backward much. might
minutes end, not much throughout entire run. Running doesn't lend
lot novel forms movement, lateral movements. nerds
movement Sagittal plane angled movements, appear things like
dance sports end generating lot dynamic movements
jumping, movement different angles, ducking,
leaping, basically involve lot dynamic movement. aren't just strictly
linear. seem open portals plasticity. mimic lot
brain circuitry associated play. reason way
dynamic movements movements different speeds engage
vestibular system. balance system, vestibular system inner ear, relates

different types motor movements can open plasticity, talk little bit more,


say lot there, suffice say engaging play lot

sports, like soccer moving different dimensions. tends
conducive call play related circuitry

01:27:36 Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty

provided don't take seriously. don't get high levels epinephrine.
Now also interested non-physical non-athletic forms play
can really expand plasticity. interesting research game
Chess. don't play game Chess. played times. confess don't know
move pieces. not going try describe here,
always wanted learn Chess. think reading Peer Reviewed
Research chess play neuroplasticity, now understand
really nice paper published International Journal Research Education
Science 2017. title paper is, "Is Chess Just Game Mirror
Reflects Child's Inner World?" very, intense title biologist like
me, paper interesting really points fact
single game chess, least understand two players, two players
moving pieces chess board, piece can different things,
right? Can move different ways different scenarios, different rules
different pieces. player actually assume multiple identities
game. identities different rules ways interacting.
way can think chess one game, actually chess kind substrate
exploring multiple roles different characters. quite bit different
instance, video games somebody favorite video game player,
avatar. always role. also quite bit different
engage kind play yourself, just
game. now highly incentivized explore chess. see quotes there,
instance, things like "Chess life jiu jitsu life." always assumed meant
someone's entire life chess entire life jiu jitsu instance,
reading research chess particular, also certain forms martial
arts, also certain forms dance. one finds indeed games life
sense involve adopting multiple roles exploring contingencies


number different ways. games allow explore much
vaster landscape movements mental roles ways engaging strategic
movement case chess. hear that, know, activity
blank life. often reflects passion activity, think looked differently.
also reflects fact activity portal can explore life
many, many different lenses. think especially powerful terms
thinking play can leveraged plasticity.
interested leveraging play neuroplasticity expanding mind, will,
highly recommend picking activity will allow adopt different roles within
activity not rigidly linear. actually way start depart
modern important, somewhat narrow idea. exercise
route plasticity. Yes, true. Nobel Prize winning colleagues swim two
miles day done long time. will tell you, always think
clearly swimming certainly experience good run
good workout, mind seems work best. Unless course, workout very,
intense. talked before. work very, hard whether
not aerobic resistance training sport kind, brain won't function
well afterwards, mostly diversion oxygen tissues away
brain, actually getting less oxygen brain, general, us feel
exercise regularly, brain functions better. activities
extend beyond linear exercise, beyond just generating sets movements
again, not exercise not. really play is. Play
dynamically exploring different kinds movements, dynamically exploring
different kinds thoughts, dynamically exploring different kinds roles one
adopt. way brain learns new things. encourage
explore chess. intend learn chess year. excited that. Now,
already play chess expert chess player, actually will derive less
benefit terms play induced neuroplasticity would, instance,
went out, don't know, played game soccer something
novel nervous system, novelty exploration new
behaviors new ways thinking, opening portal plasticity, whereas
already know trying just perform better better it,
will get better chess, again, just chess. not expanding
realms can become plastic, able learn new things

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,

me, paper interesting really points fact
single game chess, least understand two players, two players
moving pieces chess board, piece can different things,
right? Can move different ways different scenarios, different rules
different pieces. player actually assume multiple identities

way can think chess one game, actually chess kind substrate
exploring multiple roles different characters. quite bit different
instance, video games somebody favorite video game player,

extends beyond beginner's mind. Play really not even worrying going
get good really proficient it. really exploring contingencies truly
low stakes. will allow access neurochemical combinations
elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, will open

imaginary friend play, strengthening certain neural connections
pruning away 40%, perhaps even connections not necessary
certain types behaviors, emotions, thoughts. means
process play, become adults. mentioned
earlier, process play able adjust adults.
Now, bounds process, far know never reported
case individual hyperplastic say brain plastic
adulthood childhood. tells us process
play children really set rules behave adults
almost domains, really incredible. course reassuring thing
playing adult will allow expand neural circuits. can literally
grow new connections. may saying, create new neurons
better worse? not seem many new neurons added brain
adulthood. papers report neurons certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas, large, rewiring neural connections
removal certain connections. process calling Pruning strengthening
remaining connections make kind Google maps roads.
analogy laid thicker robust think taking little trails
turning roads, paving roads. turning roads
highways, putting lanes highways eliminating small
little back-country roads one take. again,

01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery

analogy happening level neuro circuitry. Now, one
key findings emerged literature children subjected
trauma immense amounts stress kind, harder time engaging
play, also harder time accessing neuroplasticity later life. good news
not permanent effect. talk ways overcome
moment, make sense earlier talked high
level adrenaline epinephrine brain body actually inhibits blocks circuits
brain body generate play behavior. say that, mean
concrete way, epinephrine adrenaline can actually suppress sorts
circuitry can lead things like soft eyes tongue out, head tilt,


called partial postures able engage in, know, rough tumble play,
not take point outright aggression damaging person
damaging you. say that, know, trauma stress can inhibit
neuroplasticity way inhibiting play deeper neuro biological level.
really saying high levels adrenaline generated trauma
stress actually shut circuits allow child young adult enter
game play game play way child young adult
didn't high levels adrenaline system possibly engage in. Now,
good news many existing trauma therapies now, including
things like EMDR Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, on,
including therapies neurochemical, things like ketamine,
engineering based, things like Transcranial magnetic stimulation instance,
many paired forms talk therapy really thing
play about, exploring different contingencies. exploring different
types emotional experiences relate sort scenario created
trauma. entire episode fear trauma, recommend
check episode. easy find hubermanlab.com, YouTube,
Apples, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera, easy find. talk trauma
treatments various kinds trauma treatments there, efficacy
different scenarios traumas on. point like make now
reason children experience lot trauma stress limited plasticity
later neurochemical substrates created trauma
stress, stress epinephrine epinephrine stress.
inseparable way less shuts least inhibits
suppresses play circuits. reassuring thing engaging
play adults, can reactivate circuits reopen plasticity. fact
one prominent trauma treatment now, especially people
subjected severe traumas, ongoing sense, meaning traumas went
many, many years get engage play things like dance basically
getting engage bodily movements ways otherwise not
feel comfortable engage in. find area interesting face
it, say, oh, kind of, know, really biomedical treatment?
know, taking people traumatized dance. mean, seems
kind silly one hand, depending your, know, particular orientation.


hand, actually quite profound quite grounded mechanisms
brain circuits change. again, back original principle,
play, isn't just one portal plasticity play fundamental portal plasticity
play dance exploration novel movements, exploration novel athletic
movements route access new ways thinking new contingencies.
find wonderful trauma release psychiatric psychology
community exploring things like play dance forms reopening
circuits indeed love magic pill trauma
erased new memories laid device that.
frankly, ask number colleagues, whether not likely
happen anytime soon effective way, think short answer going no,
going chemicals things can augment support process,
not going just magic pill will suddenly reverse trauma
altogether. always going case whereby shifts neurochemical states

01:23:25 Competition & Dynamic Movement

highly productive lever rewire traumatized brain. like
me, might thinking, okay, willing playful. willing explore, play
portal plasticity. makes good sense, play?
do? Well, already established want keep adrenaline low.
keep stakes slow enough not going get totally consumed
outcome. Now, people highly competitive, going
challenging. yet don't want make seem can't competitive
play. many forms competitive play competitive
person, allow drive great joy competitive play. friend
particularly good horseshoes. not particularly good horseshoes, whenever

neuroplasticity. particular forms play again, not designed
necessarily just engage plasticity allows perform behavior, rather
expand number possibilities brain change general throughout life
two major forms good Peer Reviewed Research
engage novel forms movement, including different speeds movement.
say instance, somebody runs. happen like running. try run three
times week. generally run, run forward, don't run backward, although
recently, become excited work so-called "Knees
Toes Guy," name Ben Parker, goes "Knees Toes Guy"
Instagram. never met him, exchanged messages back forth.
practices involve walking backwards sled poles backwards.
found beneficial back my, know, interior tibialis
things really helped posture forth. general,
run, run forward, don't tend run backward much. might
minutes end, not much throughout entire run. Running doesn't lend
lot novel forms movement, lateral movements. nerds
movement Sagittal plane angled movements, appear things like
dance sports end generating lot dynamic movements
jumping, movement different angles, ducking,
leaping, basically involve lot dynamic movement. aren't just strictly
linear. seem open portals plasticity. mimic lot
brain circuitry associated play. reason way
dynamic movements movements different speeds engage
vestibular system. balance system, vestibular system inner ear, relates
cerebellum, translates mini brain. got little mini brain back
brain. brings together visual information direct way. talked lot
episode learn faster. want go depth vestibular
different types motor movements can open plasticity, talk little bit more,


say lot there, suffice say engaging play lot
dynamic movement movements different speeds, things like dance, things like
sports, like soccer moving different dimensions. tends
conducive call play related circuitry

01:27:36 Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty

provided don't take seriously. don't get high levels epinephrine.
Now also interested non-physical non-athletic forms play
can really expand plasticity. interesting research game
Chess. don't play game Chess. played times. confess don't know
move pieces. not going try describe here,
always wanted learn Chess. think reading Peer Reviewed
Research chess play neuroplasticity, now understand
really nice paper published International Journal Research Education
Science 2017. title paper is, "Is Chess Just Game Mirror
Reflects Child's Inner World?" very, intense title biologist like
me, paper interesting really points fact
single game chess, least understand two players, two players
moving pieces chess board, piece can different things,
right? Can move different ways different scenarios, different rules
different pieces. player actually assume multiple identities
game. identities different rules ways interacting.
way can think chess one game, actually chess kind substrate
exploring multiple roles different characters. quite bit different
instance, video games somebody favorite video game player,
avatar. always role. also quite bit different
engage kind play yourself, just
game. now highly incentivized explore chess. see quotes there,
instance, things like "Chess life jiu jitsu life." always assumed meant
someone's entire life chess entire life jiu jitsu instance,
reading research chess particular, also certain forms martial
arts, also certain forms dance. one finds indeed games life
sense involve adopting multiple roles exploring contingencies


number different ways. games allow explore much
vaster landscape movements mental roles ways engaging strategic
movement case chess. hear that, know, activity
blank life. often reflects passion activity, think looked differently.
also reflects fact activity portal can explore life
many, many different lenses. think especially powerful terms
thinking play can leveraged plasticity.
interested leveraging play neuroplasticity expanding mind, will,
highly recommend picking activity will allow adopt different roles within
activity not rigidly linear. actually way start depart
modern important, somewhat narrow idea. exercise
route plasticity. Yes, true. Nobel Prize winning colleagues swim two
miles day done long time. will tell you, always think
clearly swimming certainly experience good run
good workout, mind seems work best. Unless course, workout very,
intense. talked before. work very, hard whether
not aerobic resistance training sport kind, brain won't function
well afterwards, mostly diversion oxygen tissues away
brain, actually getting less oxygen brain, general, us feel
exercise regularly, brain functions better. activities
extend beyond linear exercise, beyond just generating sets movements
again, not exercise not. really play is. Play
dynamically exploring different kinds movements, dynamically exploring
different kinds thoughts, dynamically exploring different kinds roles one
adopt. way brain learns new things. encourage
explore chess. intend learn chess year. excited that. Now,
already play chess expert chess player, actually will derive less
benefit terms play induced neuroplasticity would, instance,
went out, don't know, played game soccer something
novel nervous system, novelty exploration new
behaviors new ways thinking, opening portal plasticity, whereas
already know trying just perform better better it,
will get better chess, again, just chess. not expanding
realms can become plastic, able learn new things

two major forms good Peer Reviewed Research
engage novel forms movement, including different speeds movement.
say instance, somebody runs. happen like running. try run three

run, run forward, don't tend run backward much. might
minutes end, not much throughout entire run. Running doesn't lend
lot novel forms movement, lateral movements. nerds
movement Sagittal plane angled movements, appear things like
dance sports end generating lot dynamic movements
jumping, movement different angles, ducking,

Research chess play neuroplasticity, now understand
really nice paper published International Journal Research Education
Science 2017. title paper is, "Is Chess Just Game Mirror
Reflects Child's Inner World?" very, intense title biologist like
me, paper interesting really points fact
single game chess, least understand two players, two players
moving pieces chess board, piece can different things,
right? Can move different ways different scenarios, different rules
different pieces. player actually assume multiple identities
game. identities different rules ways interacting.
way can think chess one game, actually chess kind substrate
exploring multiple roles different characters. quite bit different
instance, video games somebody favorite video game player,
avatar. always role. also quite bit different
engage kind play yourself, just
game. now highly incentivized explore chess. see quotes there,
instance, things like "Chess life jiu jitsu life." always assumed meant
someone's entire life chess entire life jiu jitsu instance,
reading research chess particular, also certain forms martial

clearly swimming certainly experience good run
good workout, mind seems work best. Unless course, workout very,
intense. talked before. work very, hard whether
not aerobic resistance training sport kind, brain won't function
well afterwards, mostly diversion oxygen tissues away
brain, actually getting less oxygen brain, general, us feel
exercise regularly, brain functions better. activities
extend beyond linear exercise, beyond just generating sets movements
again, not exercise not. really play is. Play
dynamically exploring different kinds movements, dynamically exploring
different kinds thoughts, dynamically exploring different kinds roles one
adopt. way brain learns new things. encourage
explore chess. intend learn chess year. excited that. Now,
already play chess expert chess player, actually will derive less
benefit terms play induced neuroplasticity would, instance,
went out, don't know, played game soccer something
novel nervous system, novelty exploration new
behaviors new ways thinking, opening portal plasticity, whereas
already know trying just perform better better it,
will get better chess, again, just chess. not expanding
realms can become plastic, able learn new things

ask question, child, say 10 years old,
considered competitive? considered somebody
cooperative? realize course not mutually exclusive,
competitive cooperative. consider somebody preferred
play alone preferred play one two close friends? somebody
really enjoyed playing large groups? key one. somebody
enjoyed playing leader one moment equally okay follower
later moment? okay role switched midway
game? get upset delighted not care switch
teams middle game team winning right? even things


out, can imagine play internally. immediately register
must valuable player moved off winning team
toward losing team. again, now forced join losing team.
feel that? somebody comfortable
