00:08:01 Speech vs. Language, Difference?

drinklmnt.com/huberman. now, discussion Dr. Erich Jarvis. Erich,
great here. - Thank you. - Yeah. interested learning


speech language. even ask question, realize lot
people, including myself, probably don't fully appreciate distinction speech
language, right? Speech, think motor patterns, production sound
meaning, hopefully. language, course, comes various languages
varieties ways communicating. terms study speech language,
thinking brain organizes speech language,
similarities? differences? think speech
language? - Yeah, well, glad you, know, inviting here. also glad
get first question, consider provocative one. reason why,
struggling, difference speech language many years. realize,
struggling, behavioral terms, call 'em psychologically,
psychology developed kind terms don't actually align exactly brain function.
right. question distinction speech language?
look brain work people done, work done, also
compared animal models, like can imitate sounds like parrots
songbirds. start see really isn't sharp distinction. So, get
think going on, let tell people think now. separate
language module brain algorithms computations influence
speech pathway produce sound auditory pathway
perceive interpret speech for, know, sound call speech.
turns out, don't think good evidence separate language module.
Instead, speech production pathway controlling larynx, controlling
jaw muscles built within complex algorithms spoken language.
auditory pathway built within it, complex algorithms
understanding speech, not separate language module. speech
production pathway specialized humans parrots songbirds, whereas
auditory perception pathway ubiquitous amongst animal kingdom.
dogs can understand, "sit", "sientese", "come here, boy", "get ball" forth.
Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words. Great apes, can teach
several thousand,

00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language

can't say word. - Fascinating. raised number animal


species early a, basically obsession animals since
time small, ask, animals language? animals
modes communication sort like language. - [Erich] Yeah. - know,
heard whale songs. don't know saying. sound beautiful,
insulting know. - [Erich] Yeah. - well may
be. Dolphins, birds, mean, understand modes communication
like language, might not classically called language? - Yes,
right. So, modes communication people define language, more, very,
narrow definition, say, production sound, speech.
hands, gesturing hands? bird aerial displays
air, communicating information body language, right. Well, going go
back brain. think going spoken language, using
speech pathway complex algorithms there. Next brain regions
controlling spoken language brain regions gesturing hands.
hand parallel pathway also complex algorithms can utilize.
species advanced circuits, whether sound gesturing hands
less advanced. Now, we, humans others
advanced speech sounds spoken language, non-human primate can
produce gesturing advanced form produce sound. not sure
got across clearly, just say humans advanced spoken
language, not necessarily big difference gestural language compared
species. - clear interesting. immediately prompts
question, brain imaging sorts studies evaluating neural
activity context of, know, cultures languages, least associate
lot hand movement, like Italian. - Yep. - Versus, don't know, maybe give
us examples cultures language not associated much overt
hand movement. - Yes, talking today people
listening, can't see us, actually gesturing hands talk without
knowing unconsciously. talking telephone,
one hand gesturing hand. [Andrew laughs] Without even
seeing me, right? that? argued agree,
based upon seen evolutionary relationship
brain pathways control speech production gesturing. brain regions
mentioned directly adjacent other. that? think brain


pathways control speech evolved brain pathways control body
movement. right. talk Italian, French, English, forth,
one languages come learned set gestures can
communicate with. Now, related animals? Well, Cocoa, gorilla
raised humans 39 years more, learned gesture communication,
learned sign language, speak, right? Cocoa couldn't produce
sounds. Cocoa understand well seeing somebody sign hearing
somebody produce speech, Cocoa couldn't produce voice. so,
going number species, not them, number species
motor pathways brain can learn gesturing, rudimentary language,
wanted, say limbs, even not advanced humans. don't
extra brain pathway sound. can't gesture voice

00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution Modern Language

way gesture hands. - see. One thing wondered
long time whether not primitive emotions primitive sounds
early substrate language. whether not bridge can draw
terms just basic respiration systems associated different
extreme feelings. way imagining might work. smell something
delicious, typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. - might say, mmm, something
like that. Whereas smell something putrid, typically turn away, wince will
exhale [exhales], know sort kind like turn away, trying not ingest
molecules inhale molecules. imagine basic dark
light contrasts language system. say that, saying
orientation vision scientist thinks visual images built basic
way hierarchical map model ability see dark light. imagine
kind primitive sophisticated pyramid sound language. crazy
idea? evidence way works? - No, not crazy idea.
fact, hit upon one key distinctions field research started
in, vocal learning research. vocal communication,
vertebrate species vocalize, producing innate sounds
born producing, babies crying, example, dogs barking.
species learned vocal communication, ability imitate sounds.


makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,
sequence humans genes function speech circuits. think
Neanderthals spoken language. not going say advanced


humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area
X. - right. right, yes. - Et cetera. listeners, names
won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase
growth, becomes hard learn language adult. critical
period learn best. even later on, regular society, hard
learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's
discussion, like just briefly acknowledge sponsor, Athletic Greens, now called

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

00:08:01 Speech vs. Language, Difference?

drinklmnt.com/huberman. now, discussion Dr. Erich Jarvis. Erich,
great here. - Thank you. - Yeah. interested learning


speech language. even ask question, realize lot
people, including myself, probably don't fully appreciate distinction speech
language, right? Speech, think motor patterns, production sound
meaning, hopefully. language, course, comes various languages
varieties ways communicating. terms study speech language,
thinking brain organizes speech language,
similarities? differences? think speech
language? - Yeah, well, glad you, know, inviting here. also glad
get first question, consider provocative one. reason why,
struggling, difference speech language many years. realize,
struggling, behavioral terms, call 'em psychologically,
psychology developed kind terms don't actually align exactly brain function.
right. question distinction speech language?
look brain work people done, work done, also
compared animal models, like can imitate sounds like parrots
songbirds. start see really isn't sharp distinction. So, get
think going on, let tell people think now. separate
language module brain algorithms computations influence
speech pathway produce sound auditory pathway
perceive interpret speech for, know, sound call speech.
turns out, don't think good evidence separate language module.
Instead, speech production pathway controlling larynx, controlling
jaw muscles built within complex algorithms spoken language.
auditory pathway built within it, complex algorithms
understanding speech, not separate language module. speech
production pathway specialized humans parrots songbirds, whereas
auditory perception pathway ubiquitous amongst animal kingdom.
dogs can understand, "sit", "sientese", "come here, boy", "get ball" forth.
Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words. Great apes, can teach
several thousand,

00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language

can't say word. - Fascinating. raised number animal


species early a, basically obsession animals since
time small, ask, animals language? animals
modes communication sort like language. - [Erich] Yeah. - know,
heard whale songs. don't know saying. sound beautiful,
insulting know. - [Erich] Yeah. - well may
be. Dolphins, birds, mean, understand modes communication
like language, might not classically called language? - Yes,
right. So, modes communication people define language, more, very,
narrow definition, say, production sound, speech.
hands, gesturing hands? bird aerial displays
air, communicating information body language, right. Well, going go
back brain. think going spoken language, using
speech pathway complex algorithms there. Next brain regions
controlling spoken language brain regions gesturing hands.
hand parallel pathway also complex algorithms can utilize.
species advanced circuits, whether sound gesturing hands
less advanced. Now, we, humans others
advanced speech sounds spoken language, non-human primate can
produce gesturing advanced form produce sound. not sure
got across clearly, just say humans advanced spoken
language, not necessarily big difference gestural language compared
species. - clear interesting. immediately prompts
question, brain imaging sorts studies evaluating neural
activity context of, know, cultures languages, least associate
lot hand movement, like Italian. - Yep. - Versus, don't know, maybe give
us examples cultures language not associated much overt
hand movement. - Yes, talking today people
listening, can't see us, actually gesturing hands talk without
knowing unconsciously. talking telephone,
one hand gesturing hand. [Andrew laughs] Without even
seeing me, right? that? argued agree,
based upon seen evolutionary relationship
brain pathways control speech production gesturing. brain regions
mentioned directly adjacent other. that? think brain


pathways control speech evolved brain pathways control body
movement. right. talk Italian, French, English, forth,
one languages come learned set gestures can
communicate with. Now, related animals? Well, Cocoa, gorilla
raised humans 39 years more, learned gesture communication,
learned sign language, speak, right? Cocoa couldn't produce
sounds. Cocoa understand well seeing somebody sign hearing
somebody produce speech, Cocoa couldn't produce voice. so,
going number species, not them, number species
motor pathways brain can learn gesturing, rudimentary language,
wanted, say limbs, even not advanced humans. don't
extra brain pathway sound. can't gesture voice

00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution Modern Language

way gesture hands. - see. One thing wondered
long time whether not primitive emotions primitive sounds
early substrate language. whether not bridge can draw
terms just basic respiration systems associated different
extreme feelings. way imagining might work. smell something
delicious, typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. - might say, mmm, something
like that. Whereas smell something putrid, typically turn away, wince will
exhale [exhales], know sort kind like turn away, trying not ingest
molecules inhale molecules. imagine basic dark
light contrasts language system. say that, saying
orientation vision scientist thinks visual images built basic
way hierarchical map model ability see dark light. imagine
kind primitive sophisticated pyramid sound language. crazy
idea? evidence way works? - No, not crazy idea.
fact, hit upon one key distinctions field research started
in, vocal learning research. vocal communication,
vertebrate species vocalize, producing innate sounds
born producing, babies crying, example, dogs barking.
species learned vocal communication, ability imitate sounds.


makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,
sequence humans genes function speech circuits. think
Neanderthals spoken language. not going say advanced


humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area

won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase

learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting

fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

speech language. even ask question, realize lot
people, including myself, probably don't fully appreciate distinction speech
language, right? Speech, think motor patterns, production sound
meaning, hopefully. language, course, comes various languages
varieties ways communicating. terms study speech language,
thinking brain organizes speech language,
similarities? differences? think speech
language? - Yeah, well, glad you, know, inviting here. also glad
get first question, consider provocative one. reason why,
struggling, difference speech language many years. realize,
struggling, behavioral terms, call 'em psychologically,
psychology developed kind terms don't actually align exactly brain function.
right. question distinction speech language?
look brain work people done, work done, also
compared animal models, like can imitate sounds like parrots
songbirds. start see really isn't sharp distinction. So, get
think going on, let tell people think now. separate
language module brain algorithms computations influence
speech pathway produce sound auditory pathway
perceive interpret speech for, know, sound call speech.
turns out, don't think good evidence separate language module.
Instead, speech production pathway controlling larynx, controlling
jaw muscles built within complex algorithms spoken language.
auditory pathway built within it, complex algorithms
understanding speech, not separate language module. speech
production pathway specialized humans parrots songbirds, whereas
auditory perception pathway ubiquitous amongst animal kingdom.
dogs can understand, "sit", "sientese", "come here, boy", "get ball" forth.
Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words. Great apes, can teach
several thousand,

00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language

can't say word. - Fascinating. raised number animal


species early a, basically obsession animals since
time small, ask, animals language? animals
modes communication sort like language. - [Erich] Yeah. - know,
heard whale songs. don't know saying. sound beautiful,
insulting know. - [Erich] Yeah. - well may
be. Dolphins, birds, mean, understand modes communication
like language, might not classically called language? - Yes,
right. So, modes communication people define language, more, very,
narrow definition, say, production sound, speech.
hands, gesturing hands? bird aerial displays
air, communicating information body language, right. Well, going go
back brain. think going spoken language, using
speech pathway complex algorithms there. Next brain regions
controlling spoken language brain regions gesturing hands.
hand parallel pathway also complex algorithms can utilize.
species advanced circuits, whether sound gesturing hands
less advanced. Now, we, humans others
advanced speech sounds spoken language, non-human primate can
produce gesturing advanced form produce sound. not sure
got across clearly, just say humans advanced spoken
language, not necessarily big difference gestural language compared
species. - clear interesting. immediately prompts
question, brain imaging sorts studies evaluating neural
activity context of, know, cultures languages, least associate
lot hand movement, like Italian. - Yep. - Versus, don't know, maybe give
us examples cultures language not associated much overt
hand movement. - Yes, talking today people
listening, can't see us, actually gesturing hands talk without
knowing unconsciously. talking telephone,
one hand gesturing hand. [Andrew laughs] Without even
seeing me, right? that? argued agree,
based upon seen evolutionary relationship
brain pathways control speech production gesturing. brain regions
mentioned directly adjacent other. that? think brain


pathways control speech evolved brain pathways control body
movement. right. talk Italian, French, English, forth,
one languages come learned set gestures can
communicate with. Now, related animals? Well, Cocoa, gorilla
raised humans 39 years more, learned gesture communication,
learned sign language, speak, right? Cocoa couldn't produce
sounds. Cocoa understand well seeing somebody sign hearing
somebody produce speech, Cocoa couldn't produce voice. so,
going number species, not them, number species
motor pathways brain can learn gesturing, rudimentary language,
wanted, say limbs, even not advanced humans. don't
extra brain pathway sound. can't gesture voice

00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution Modern Language

way gesture hands. - see. One thing wondered
long time whether not primitive emotions primitive sounds
early substrate language. whether not bridge can draw
terms just basic respiration systems associated different
extreme feelings. way imagining might work. smell something
delicious, typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. - might say, mmm, something
like that. Whereas smell something putrid, typically turn away, wince will
exhale [exhales], know sort kind like turn away, trying not ingest
molecules inhale molecules. imagine basic dark
light contrasts language system. say that, saying
orientation vision scientist thinks visual images built basic
way hierarchical map model ability see dark light. imagine
kind primitive sophisticated pyramid sound language. crazy
idea? evidence way works? - No, not crazy idea.
fact, hit upon one key distinctions field research started
in, vocal learning research. vocal communication,
vertebrate species vocalize, producing innate sounds
born producing, babies crying, example, dogs barking.
species learned vocal communication, ability imitate sounds.


makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,

won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like

become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits

identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

species early a, basically obsession animals since
time small, ask, animals language? animals
modes communication sort like language. - [Erich] Yeah. - know,
heard whale songs. don't know saying. sound beautiful,
insulting know. - [Erich] Yeah. - well may
be. Dolphins, birds, mean, understand modes communication
like language, might not classically called language? - Yes,
right. So, modes communication people define language, more, very,
narrow definition, say, production sound, speech.
hands, gesturing hands? bird aerial displays
air, communicating information body language, right. Well, going go
back brain. think going spoken language, using
speech pathway complex algorithms there. Next brain regions
controlling spoken language brain regions gesturing hands.
hand parallel pathway also complex algorithms can utilize.
species advanced circuits, whether sound gesturing hands
less advanced. Now, we, humans others
advanced speech sounds spoken language, non-human primate can
produce gesturing advanced form produce sound. not sure
got across clearly, just say humans advanced spoken
language, not necessarily big difference gestural language compared
species. - clear interesting. immediately prompts
question, brain imaging sorts studies evaluating neural
activity context of, know, cultures languages, least associate
lot hand movement, like Italian. - Yep. - Versus, don't know, maybe give
us examples cultures language not associated much overt
hand movement. - Yes, talking today people
listening, can't see us, actually gesturing hands talk without
knowing unconsciously. talking telephone,
one hand gesturing hand. [Andrew laughs] Without even
seeing me, right? that? argued agree,
based upon seen evolutionary relationship
brain pathways control speech production gesturing. brain regions
mentioned directly adjacent other. that? think brain


pathways control speech evolved brain pathways control body
movement. right. talk Italian, French, English, forth,
one languages come learned set gestures can
communicate with. Now, related animals? Well, Cocoa, gorilla
raised humans 39 years more, learned gesture communication,
learned sign language, speak, right? Cocoa couldn't produce
sounds. Cocoa understand well seeing somebody sign hearing
somebody produce speech, Cocoa couldn't produce voice. so,
going number species, not them, number species
motor pathways brain can learn gesturing, rudimentary language,
wanted, say limbs, even not advanced humans. don't
extra brain pathway sound. can't gesture voice

00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution Modern Language

way gesture hands. - see. One thing wondered
long time whether not primitive emotions primitive sounds
early substrate language. whether not bridge can draw
terms just basic respiration systems associated different
extreme feelings. way imagining might work. smell something
delicious, typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. - might say, mmm, something
like that. Whereas smell something putrid, typically turn away, wince will
exhale [exhales], know sort kind like turn away, trying not ingest
molecules inhale molecules. imagine basic dark
light contrasts language system. say that, saying
orientation vision scientist thinks visual images built basic
way hierarchical map model ability see dark light. imagine
kind primitive sophisticated pyramid sound language. crazy
idea? evidence way works? - No, not crazy idea.
fact, hit upon one key distinctions field research started
in, vocal learning research. vocal communication,
vertebrate species vocalize, producing innate sounds
born producing, babies crying, example, dogs barking.
species learned vocal communication, ability imitate sounds.


makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,
sequence humans genes function speech circuits. think
Neanderthals spoken language. not going say advanced


humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area
X. - right. right, yes. - Et cetera. listeners, names
won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase
growth, becomes hard learn language adult. critical
period learn best. even later on, regular society, hard
learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

pathways control speech evolved brain pathways control body
movement. right. talk Italian, French, English, forth,
one languages come learned set gestures can
communicate with. Now, related animals? Well, Cocoa, gorilla
raised humans 39 years more, learned gesture communication,
learned sign language, speak, right? Cocoa couldn't produce
sounds. Cocoa understand well seeing somebody sign hearing
somebody produce speech, Cocoa couldn't produce voice. so,
going number species, not them, number species
motor pathways brain can learn gesturing, rudimentary language,
wanted, say limbs, even not advanced humans. don't
extra brain pathway sound. can't gesture voice

00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution Modern Language

way gesture hands. - see. One thing wondered
long time whether not primitive emotions primitive sounds
early substrate language. whether not bridge can draw
terms just basic respiration systems associated different
extreme feelings. way imagining might work. smell something
delicious, typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. - might say, mmm, something
like that. Whereas smell something putrid, typically turn away, wince will
exhale [exhales], know sort kind like turn away, trying not ingest
molecules inhale molecules. imagine basic dark
light contrasts language system. say that, saying
orientation vision scientist thinks visual images built basic
way hierarchical map model ability see dark light. imagine
kind primitive sophisticated pyramid sound language. crazy
idea? evidence way works? - No, not crazy idea.
fact, hit upon one key distinctions field research started
in, vocal learning research. vocal communication,
vertebrate species vocalize, producing innate sounds
born producing, babies crying, example, dogs barking.
species learned vocal communication, ability imitate sounds.


makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,
sequence humans genes function speech circuits. think
Neanderthals spoken language. not going say advanced


humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area
X. - right. right, yes. - Et cetera. listeners, names
won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase
growth, becomes hard learn language adult. critical
period learn best. even later on, regular society, hard
learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,

family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

makes spoken language special. people think special
language, learned vocalizations. rare. so, distinction
innateness learned bigger dichotomy comes
vocalizations behaviors animal kingdom. go
brain, see well. things talked about, breathing,
grunting forth, lot handled brain stem circuits, know, right
around level neck below. Like reflex kind thing. So, even
emotional aspects behavior hypothalamus forth. learned
behavior, learning speak, learning play piano, teaching dog learn
tricks using forebrain circuits. happened
lot forebrain circuits controlling, learning move body parts
species, not vocalizations. humans parrots
species, somehow, acquired circuits forebrain taken brain
stem now using brain stem, not produce innate behaviors vocal
behaviors, learned ones well. - sense modern
sophisticated language evolved? know, thinking back species evolved
from, even within Homo sapiens, evolution language?
devolution language? [laughs] - Yeah. Yeah, say, able
answer question, come caveat think humans overrate
compared species. makes even scientists go astray trying
hypothesize when, especially don't find fossil evidence language easily
terms happened past. Amongst primates, humans
belong to, ones advanced vocal learning ability. Now,
assumed Homo sapiens, can go back time now based
upon genomic data, not us living humans, fossils found
Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovan individuals discover
ancestor, human ancestors, supposedly hybridized hominid
species. assumed hominid species don't learn imitate
sounds. don't know species today vocal learner can children
non-vocal learning species. don't see it. Doesn't mean didn't exist.
look genetic data ancestral hominids, that, know, can
look genes involved learned vocal communication,
sequence humans genes function speech circuits. think
Neanderthals spoken language. not going say advanced


humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area
X. - right. right, yes. - Et cetera. listeners, names
won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase
growth, becomes hard learn language adult. critical
period learn best. even later on, regular society, hard
learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

humans. don't know. think least 500,000 million
years ancestors ability coming
advanced culturally possibly genetically. think evolved sometime

00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders

last 500,000 million years. - Incredible. Maybe talk little bit
overlap brain circuits control language speech humans
animals. weaned neuroscience era birdsong ability
birds learn tooter song still prominent field, subfield
neuroscience. course, neuroimaging humans speaking learning, et
cetera, notion critical period, time language learned
easily later life. names different brain areas quite
different. one opens textbooks, hear Wernicke's Broca's humans.
look birds it, remember, know. - HVC. - Robustus, striatum. Area
X. - right. right, yes. - Et cetera. listeners, names
won't mean whole lot, terms homologies areas terms function,
know? similar different brain areas controlling speech
language say songbird young human child? - Yeah, so, going back
1950s even little earlier, Peter Muller others got involved
neurotology, study neurobiology behavior natural way, right. know,
start find behaviorally, species birds like songbirds
parrots, now also know hummingbirds, just three 40-
something bird groups planet, orders, can imitate sounds like
do. similarity. words, kind behavior
similar us chimpanzees us chickens them,
right, closer relatives. discovered even similarities,
critical periods remove child, know, unfortunately happens
child feral not raised human goes puberty phase
growth, becomes hard learn language adult. critical
period learn best. even later on, regular society, hard
learn. Well, birds undergo thing. discovered
become deaf, humans become deaf, speech starts deteriorate without
kind therapy. non-human primate or, know, say chicken


becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

becomes deaf, vocalizations don't deteriorate. little least. Well, happens
vocal learning birds. behavioral parallels came along
package, people looked brain. Fernando Nottebohm, former
PhD advisor, began discover Area X talked about, robust nucleus
archipallium. brain pathways not found species couldn't
imitate parallel here. jumping many years later, know,
started dig brain circuits discover brain circuits
parallel functions brain circuits humans, even though different
name, like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. recently, discovered not
actual circuitry connectivity similar, underlying genes
expressed brain regions specialized way, different rest brain,
also similar humans, songbirds parrots. way
genes. now finding specific mutations also similar, not always
identical, similar, indicates remarkable convergence so-called complex
behavior species separated 300 million years common ancestor. not
that, discovering mutations genes cause speech deficits
humans, like FOXP2, put mutations similar type deficits
vocal learning birds, get similar deficits. convergence behavior
associated similar genetic disorders behavior. - Incredible. ask,
hummingbird sing, hum? - Hummingbirds hum wings sing
syrinx. - coordinated way? - coordinated way. species
hummingbirds actually will, Doug Ashler showed this, will flap wings
create slapping sound wings unison song
not know it, sounds like particular syllable songs, even though
wings voice time. - Hummingbirds clapping song? -
Clapping their, snapping wings together unison song make
like, going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] banged table
except make almost sound like voice wings. - Incredible. - Yes. - I,
I'm... - got smallest brains around. - kids say mind
blown, right? - Yes. Yes. - Incredible. - Yes. - Incredible, love hummingbirds.
always feel like special thing get moment see one move
around fast fled away fast ballistic trajectories. - [Erich] Yep. -
get see one stationary moment, even just hovering there,
feel like extracting much little microcosm life, now realize


playing music essentially. - Right, exactly. amazing
hummingbirds going say, vocal learning species general,
whatever reason, seem evolve multiple complex traits. know, idea
evolving language, spoken language particular,

00:27:11 Innate Predisposition Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization

comes along set specializations. - Incredible. - Yeah. - coming
neuroscience, learned think work Peter Muller young birds
learn, songbirds learned tooter song learn quite well, learn
song another tooter. words, learn different,
listeners, air quotes here, "a different language", "a different bird song",
different species song. never well learn
natural genetically linked song. - Yes. - Genetically linked, meaning like
raised different culture, learn language, not
well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

well learned English. idea. - Yes. - true? -
true, yes. learned growing well. talked Peter Muller
passed. Yeah, used call innate predisposition
learn. right. kind equivalent linguistic community
universal grammar. something genetically influencing vocal communication
top learned culturally. balance genetic
control speech song birds learned cultural control. so, yes,
take, know, mean, case, actually tried Rockefeller
later on. Take zebra finch raise canary, sing song sort
like hybrid between. call can-inch, right? [both laughing] vice versa
canary, something different vocal musculature
circuitry brain. zebra finch, even closely related species,
take zebra finch, young animal, one cage next placed
species, adult male, right. cage placed Bengalese finch next it,
preferably learn song species neighbor. remove
neighbor, learn Bengalese finch well. - [Andrew] Fantastic. -
something also social bonding species. - Incredible.
raises question I, based something also heard, don't scientific
peer-reviewed publication point to, idea Pidgin not bird,


idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's
discussion, like just briefly acknowledge sponsor, Athletic Greens, now called
AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AGI, all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink also
adaptogens digestive enzymes. taking Athletic Greens since way back
2012 delighted sponsoring podcast. reason started taking
Athletic Greens reason still drink Athletic Greens twice day supplies
total foundational coverage vitamin mineral needs supplies important
nutrients need support gut microbiome. gut microbiome, many
know, supports immune system also supports so-called gut brain access,
vital mood, energy levels, regulating focus many features

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

idea multiple cultures languages converge given geographic area,
children different native languages will come language.
think island culture, maybe Hawaii, called Pidgin, sort hybrid
various languages parents speak home
speak. somehow Pidgin again, not bird, language called Pidgin,
reasons, don't know, harbors certain basic elements language. true?
not true? - say, haven't studied enough terms Pidgin, specifically,
terms cultural evolution language hybridization different cultures
forth, even amongst birds different dialects bring together,
know, going cultural evolution remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
bring people two separate populations together
separate populations, evolutionarily, least hundreds generations, someone's
speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, child learning
them. Yes, child's going able pick merge phonemes words
together way adult wouldn't, because, why? experiencing
languages time critical period years, way adults
not able experience. get hybrid. lowest common
denominator going share. phonemes re
retained

00:31:34 Genes Speech & Language

languages going be, imagine, used most. - Interesting.
got brain circuits songbirds humans many ways similar,
perhaps not exact wiring, basic contour wiring. genes
expressed sets neural circuits distinct species responsible
phenomenon calling speech language. sorts things
genes controlling? imagine controlling wiring connections
brain areas. know, essentially map of, know, circuit, basically
like engineer design circuit speech language, nature designed
circuit speech language, presumably things too. Like ability
connect motor patterns within throat muscles within throat, control
tongue. mean, genes doing? - pretty good, yeah.
made good guesses makes sense. So, yes, one things


differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

differ speech pathways us song pathways birds
connections fundamentally different surrounding circuits, like direct
cortical connection areas control vocalizations cortex motor
neurons control larynx, humans syrinx birds. actually
made prediction since connections differ, going find genes
control neural connectivity, specialize function, differ.
exactly found. Genes control call axon guidance form
neuronal connections, interesting, sort opposite direction
expected. is, genes, actually, number control
neural connectivity turned off speech circuit, right. didn't make
sense us first started realize function genes repel
connections forming, repulsive molecules. turn off,
allow certain connections form normally not formed. turning
off, gain function speech, right? genes surprised us genes
involved calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin heat-shock proteins,
brain gets hot, proteins turn on. couldn't figure long
time, case? idea popped one day said, ah,
heard larynx fastest firing muscles body, right. order vibrate
sound modulate sound way do, control, move
muscles, know, three four five times faster just regular walking
running. stick electrodes brain areas control learned
vocalizations birds think humans well, neurons firing
higher rate control muscles. going do? going
lots toxicity neurons, unless upregulate molecules take
extra load needed control larynx. finally, third set genes
specialized speech circuit involved neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity,
meaning allowing brain circuits flexible can learn better.
that? think learning produce speech complex learning ability
say learning walk learning tricks jumps forth dogs
do. - Yeah, interesting say that, realize many aspects
speech sort reflexive. not thinking word going say, just
sort roll mouth, hopefully forethought. know people
seem speak, think less, fewer synapses brain mouth
others, right. - Yes. - lot examples there, people deliberate


speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

speech,

00:35:49 Learning New Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes

nonetheless, much speech precise. less precise.
terms plasticity speech ability learn multiple languages, even just one
language, going critical period, so-called critical period? - Yeah. -
that, niece speaks Spanish. Guatemalan speaks Spanish
English incredibly well. 14-years-old. struggled Spanish whole life.
father bilingual. mother not. tried learn Spanish adult. really
challenging. told learned eight, better off. -
right. - installed within me. first question is, easier learn
multiple languages without accent early life? so, why? second
question one can already speak one language consequence
childhood learning, easier acquire new languages later on? - So, answer
questions yes, that, explain this, need let know, actually
entire brain undergoing critical period development, not just speech
pathways. easier learn play piano. easier learn ride
bike first time forth young child later life. mean
easier terms start first principles learning something.
first time, going learn Chinese child versus first time learn
Chinese adult learning play piano child versus adult. speech
pathways, say speech behavior, think stronger critical period change
circuits. why, going general? need
critical period make stable, make stubborn, speak?
reason believe brain not for, brain can hold much information.
undergoing rapid learning learn, acquire new knowledge, also
to, know, dumb stuff. Put memory information trash, like
computer. many gigabases memory. therefore, plus also
survival, don't want keep forgetting things. brain designed, believe,
undergo critical period solidify circuits learned child
use rest life. humans stay even plastic
brain functions controlled gene called srGAP2. extra copy
leads speech circuit brain regions immature state throughout life


compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)



speak one language. [both laughing] continue today's

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

compared animals. immature. still juvenile like compared
animals. - knew it. - still go critical periods like do.
now question asked about, learn languages child,
easier learn adult? common finding literature.
argue it. support it, idea is,
born set innate sounds can produce phonemes. narrow
not languages use them. narrow ones
use string phonemes together, words learn maintain
phonemes adult. comes along another language using
phonemes different combinations not used to. therefore, like starting
first principles, already multiple languages using,
makes easier use another third fourth language. - see, incredible.
- So, not like brain maintained greater plasticity, brain
maintained greater ability produce different sounds allows learn
another language faster. - Got it. hand gestures associated sounds
meanings words? - think hand gestures associated sounds
meaning. say sound like really angry, right, making
loud screaming noise, right, may make hand gestures look like going
beat wall, right? making loud sounds loud gestures, right.
want explain something like, come here, just now
can't see me, swung hand towards swung me.
meaning it, come here. just like voice, hand gestures producing
both, know, qualities sound. - people speak multiple languages,
especially learn multiple languages early development,
switch patterns motor movements according say, going Italian
Arabic Arabic French way matches precision language
speaking? - know what? just asked question, don't know
answer to. imagine make sense switching terms
sometimes people might call code switching, even different dialects
language. gestures? imagine so, really don't know
true not. - Okay, well, certainly don't know experience

00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation. Again, can go
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. go little bit
abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

abstract, not far, modes speech language seem
depth emotionality meaning, departs structured language.
mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. - think musicians, like Bob
Dylan songs that, me, understand individual words. like think
emotion associated it. least, experience sort emotion
guess experiencing. just read linearly without
music without singing it, somebody singing like him, wouldn't hold
meaning. words, words seem meaning, not associated
language, somehow tap emotionality. - Yep, absolutely. So, call
difference semantic communication, communication meaning effective
communication, communication emotional feeling content it,
know, not with, know, semantics. two can mixed up, like
singing words meaning, also effect emotional, just love


sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,

people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even

slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

sound singer hearing. initially, know, psychologists, scientists,
general, thought going controlled different brain circuits.
case. emotional brain centers hypothalamus, cingulate
cortex forth, give tone sounds. believe, know, based upon
imaging work work see birds, birds communicating semantic
information sounds, not often, happens, versus effective
communication, sing trying attract mate, courtship song defend
territory, brain circuits. speech-like song, circuits
used different ways. - friend mine, also therapist, said me,
know, possible say, love intense hatred say, hate
intense love. - [Eric] Right. - reminding possible hear
statements either way. guess not just limited song poetry. also,
something intention emotional context something spoken
can heavily shape way interpret hear. - right. consider
actually, meaning, even though defined as, people commonly semantic
effective communication. Effective communication say, hate you, meant
love, right, emotional meaning it, know? so, know, one's
like object kind meaning abstract kind meaning. several
points think important listening hear say
also effective semantic communication used similar brain circuits,
also matters, side brain. birds humans, left-right dominance
learned communication, learned sound communication. left us humans
dominant speech, right balance singing processing
musical sounds opposed processing speech. get used reasons.
people say right brain artistic brain left brain
thinking brain, referring to. another distinction. second
thing useful know vocal learning species use learned sounds
emotional effective kind communication, like humans
parrots dolphins use semantic kind communication, calling
speech. led number people hypothesize evolution spoken
language, speech, evolved first singing, like emotional kind mate
attraction like Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin kind songs forth.
later on, became used abstract communication



00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

00:47:32 Singing, Link Dancing & Vocal Learning

like now. - Oh, interesting. Well, perfect segue able
ask background motor control, not hands body.
number important distinctions name, one
member Alvin Ailey Dance School, School Dance. - right.
right, hmm hmm. - accomplished quite able dancer, right? Tell
us little bit background world dance informs
interest neuroscience, [clears throat], excuse me, perhaps even relates
specifically work speech language. - Yes, well, interesting.
kind history even goes time. family, mother father's
side, went High School Music Art New York City.
particularly, mother's family, going back multiple generations, singers.
even family genealogy found not only, know,
relationships well-known singers, distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
going back plantations North Carolina forth, ancestors singers
church the, know, towns forth. somehow got passed
multiple generations family. thought going grow
famous singer, right. brothers sister formed band
kids forth. turned didn't inherit singing talents
family members, even though, know, was, know, okay. know,
not like brother, not like mother aunts cousin Pura Fe',
now talented Native American singer. so, influenced
things. started, know, competing dance contests, know, actually
around time Saturday Night Fever teenager. started winning
dance contests. thought, oh, can dance. auditioned High School
Performing Arts. got in, New York City, got ballet dance got in,
right. thought, learned ballet, can learn everything else. idea, learn
something classical, can teach everything else. was, yeah, Alvin Ailey
Dance School, Joffrey Ballet Dance School. end senior concert,
opportunity audition Alvin Ailey Dance Company. opportunity
go college. also fell love another passion father had,
science. liked science high school. found overlap also
arts sciences, know, required creativity, hard work, discipline,


know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

know, new discovery, weren't boring me. one decision made
senior dance concert was, know, talking Alvin Ailey recruiter
thinking it, make decision. thought something mother taught
growing 1960s cultural revolution, "Do something
positive impact society." thought better dancer
scientist. now jump, get college, undergraduate school, major
molecular biology mathematics. decide want biologist, got graduate
school, wanted study brain at, know, Rockefeller University. went
Hunter College Rockefeller University. now got brain
choose brain controls dancing. [laughs] wasn't anybody
studying dancing. wanted study brain, something really
interesting complex. thought, ah, language does. couldn't study
mice. couldn't study non-human primates. birds
wonderful thing Fernando Nottebohm studying Rockefeller.
got birds. jumping now, 15 years later, know, yeah,
right. Even now lab, studying vocal learning birds
model language humans, turns that, know, Ani Patel and,
know, others, discovered vocal learning species can learn dance. -
right? - right, yes. - seen just scrolling files
mind. think about, every someone will, love parrots. - Yes. -
every while, someone will send one little Instagram Twitter
videos parrot looks like dance, typically cockatoo. -
right. - Right. - right. - Even foot stomping sound and- - Famous one called
Snowball there, many Snowballs there. [laughs] - dancing
birds named Snowball? interesting tactic. animals language
dance? - Yeah, vocal learning particular, ability imitate sounds, yes. - Incredible.
- Yes.

00:52:55 Motor Theory Vocal Learning, Dance

now bringing life full circle, right. discovered
2009, time lab Duke, discovered vocal learning brain
pathways songbirds, well humans parrots, right, like Snowball,
embedded within circuits control learning move. led us theory


called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

called Brain Pathway Motor Theory Vocal Learning Origin brain
pathways vocal learning speech evolved whole duplication
surrounding motor circuits involving learning move. Now, explain
dance, right? Well, Snowball, cockatoos, dancing, using brain
regions around speech-like circuits dancing behavior.
going there? hypothesize now like test this,
speech evolved humans equivalent behavior parrots songbirds,
required tight integration brain regions can hear sound brain
regions control muscles moving larynx tongue forth
producing sound. tight auditory motor integration, argue, contaminated
surrounding brain regions. contamination surrounding brain regions
now allows us humans, particular, parrots. coordinate muscle movements
rest body sound way speech sounds. - [Andrew]
Well. - speaking bodies dance. - Incredible. say
poor speaking multiple languages, even worse dancing, so. -
guarantee better monkey. - not Snowball, cockatoo? - No, maybe
not Snowball. YouTube, video scientists dancing
Snowball see Snowballs better scientists. - Okay, well,
long not worst scientists dancing. - don't think so.

00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions

- always neuroplasticity. May save someday. said something
incredible completely believe even though minimum to, just say
minimum dancing ability. Okay, can get party wedding without complete
embarrassment, don't structured training. body clearly can
communicate movement. trained dancer knowing trained dancers,
always think dance bodily movement communication bodily
movement form wordlessness, like state wordlessness. fact, times
think maybe actually dancing modestly well context in,
see people dancing seem just much movement,
almost like state non-language, non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. - yet
telling direct bridge level movement
body language. language body distinct


language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

language speech? so, not, map onto one another?
Venn diagram look like? - Yeah, yeah. So, let define first dance
context vocal learning species. kind dancing specialized
vocal learning species specialized synchronizing body
movements muscles rhythmic beats music. reason, like
that. like synchronizing sound together group people.
kind communication amongst like effective kind
communication mentioned earlier, unlike semantic kind. we, humans, using
voices semantic, abstract communication, using learned
dance effective emotional bonding kind communication. doesn't mean
can't communicate semantic information dance, it, not popular.
know, like ballet that, know, Nutcracker, popular, know,
communicating, know, Arabian guy comes out, Arabian
guy ballet Nutcracker. remember. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah,
Westchester Ballet Company, teenager. know, trying
communicate meaning ballet dancing, can go whole story
forth. people don't interpret clearly speech. know, seeing
ballet semantic communication, lot emotional content, whereas go
club, know, yeah, not communicating, okay, feeling today?
Tell day forth. trying synchronize people
effective way. think because, dance brain circuit inherited
ancient part speech circuit, singing. - always feeling
certain forms music, particular opera, kind music
long notes sung level, literal resonance created
singer listener. think like deep voice Johnny Cash
level, can almost feel voice body. theory,
vibration firing phrenic nerve controlling diaphragm
know. evidence coordination performer audience
level mind body? - going say, possibly, yes. reason
just came back conference neurobiology dance- - Clearly,
going wrong meetings. - Yeah, colleague invited me. - know, vision science
sounds boring. - Yes, well, one colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch Jonathan
Fritz, organized, well, particular section conference Virginia.
first time room many neuroscientists studying neurobiology


dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

dance. new field now, last five years. one lab
putting EEG electrodes dancers, two different dancers partnering
other, well audience, know, seeing dance some, know,
argued, okay, listening music well, responding 'cause
asking question music giving answer dance.
found that, know, dancers, resonated
dance, audience listening dancers music,
resonance going score higher resonance. brain activity
wireless EEG signals showing something different.
say possibly, yes. needs rigorous study know, stuff
publish, not prime time yet, trying figure out. - Love it.
least can't dance well, maybe can hear feel dance certain way.
- Yes, right. will be, people will think they, even songs
hear can almost sing head know
want sound like. know really sounds good, sounds like,
can't get voice it. - raising, listening, raising hand. No
musical ability. Others household tremendous musical ability
instruments voice, not me. - Yeah, well, one selfish
goals trying find genetics can people sing really well
not. genetic predisposition that? can modify
muscles brain circuits sing better? - still sing. guess
happens siblings vary proficiency competitiveness amongst brothers
sisters never goes away. - trying good brother, Mark Victor,
know, entire life. - Well, watch out, Mark Victor, coming
neuroscience back him. Earlier, said discovered dance.
caught ear. sounds like didn't actually to, not suggesting
didn't work hard it. moment discovered it, just sort skill
had, point, didn't target life world dance,
fact quote, unquote, "discovered dance really well" went
incredible school dance well, tells perhaps ability
built childhood perhaps different genetic
leanings different motor functions. - Yeah, well, me, be,
explanations possible. first, yeah, grew family, listening
Motown songs, know, dancing, know, parties forth, family parties and,


know, African American family, basically. grew dancing young
child, discovery, know, maybe dancing even moreso, terms talent,
could, genetic component, really exists, don't know. know,
23andMe results, know, says genetic substitutions associated
with, know, high intensity athletes fast twitch muscles. knows. Maybe
something able synchronize body rhythmic
sounds, maybe, maybe, better others. turns genetics also show
genetic substitute makes hard sing pitch.
correlate my, know, even though can sing pitch, especially
hear piano or, know, kind playing it, but, know, maybe
siblings, know, didn't genetic predisposition 23andMe results,
know, go along genetic component, well. - imagining family
gatherings 23andMe data intense arguments it, innate learned
ability. - Yes. - Fun. Love attendant. not inviting Thanksgiving
dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

dinner way, suppose am.

01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions

- welcome to. - Thank you. bring 23andMe data. love chat moment
facial expression form motor pattern that, know, think
people just think smiling frowning, are, course,
know, thousands, not millions micro expressions things sort, many
subconscious. familiar fact somebody
says doesn't match specific feature facial expression can call,
know, mismatch can cue attention, especially among people know
well. Like somebody will say, well, said that, right eye twitched
the, know, little bit way tells didn't really mean that,
kinds things. when, opposite example, emotionality content
speech matched facial expression, something just
wonderful that, seems like everything's aligned. - [Erich] Yeah. -
motor circuitry controls facial expression map onto brain circuits
control language, speech, even bodily hand movements? - Yeah,
ask great question know colleagues like Winrich Freiwald
Rockefeller University study facial expression neurology behind it. now


share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

share students co-mentoring. talk
question brought up. learning lot non-human primates
lot diversity facial expression like humans do. know
neurobiology brain regions controlling muscles face
non-human primates species don't learn imitate
vocalizations, strong connections cortical regions motor
neurons control facial expressions, absent connections weak connections
motor neurons control voice. think diverse facial expression, even
though diverse non-human primates, already preexisting
diversity communication, whether intentional unconscious facial
expression ancestors. top that, humans now add voice along
facial expressions. - see. terms language learning kids,
mean, children, fortunately not told fake expressions smile
say happy. point, everybody learns, better worse,
untangle different components hand movement, body posture, speech,
facial expression. - [Erich] Yes. - best form, say, assuming
best form always, guess instances where, know, safety reasons,
one might need fain aspects language. cases,
aligned, seems like reflect different circuitries
operating parallel, ability misalign also powerful aspect
maturation. can think theater, instance, deliberate disentangling
areas important. also know actor, feels real. - Yep. -
looks like, bad acting oftentimes facial expression body
posture just doesn't quite match hearing. - [Erich] Yeah. - skills
people, learn acquire according adaptability profession?
think children adults eventually learn couple uncouple
circuits little bit? - Yeah, think similar argument mentioned earlier
innate learned vocalizations. way, say, humans
facial expressions associated vocalizations different way primates,
non-human primates, learned vocalizations talking about.
common view facial expressions non-human species like nonhuman
primates, can birds, too, innate, right. reflexive
controlled. don't believe that. think learned component it.
think learning component well, also innate


component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder

hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot

component. try put hands behind back hold fist,
even just not, try speak try communicate, actually harder do.
force put side. comes naturally. Facial expressions
comes naturally innate component. yes, learn
dissociate two, communicate something angry hands face,
but, know, politely voice. hard separate two,
innate component brings together. like email, too.
emailing someone says something email, someone can interpret
angrily gently,

01:09:35 Reading & Writing

becomes ambiguous. facial expressions get rid ambiguity. - glad
brought next question was, written language.
first question ask write, either type write things hand,
hear content want write head? Just, personally. - Yes,
do. Yeah, know do, trying figure debate
issue trying resolve debate self experimentation me. - asked
because, quite well-known colleague ours, Karl Deisseroth Stanford,
podcast, know, optogenetics fame psychiatry fame, et cetera. -
Yeah, know him. - Yeah, sends regards. - Okay. [laughs] - Told
practice writing thinking involves quite painful process forcing
sit completely still think complete sentences, force thinking complete
sentences. told that, decided try exercise quite difficult.
First all, difficult reason mentioned, many
thoughts, want look around start gesticulate hands, right?
is, again, connection language hand movement, even one isn't
speaking. part challenging realize write complete
sentences, time, talk changing now. - Right. -
texting, et cetera. don't often think complete sentences, specifically
simple declarative sentences, lot thoughts be, written
onto page look pretty much like passive language good copy editor
good editor say, ugh, like need cross out, make simple
declarative. getting process going thought


language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without

language, written word? also wanted touch handwritten versus typed,
thought language, written word. going there? know
neural circuitry? going ask, hard? now want ask
even possible? seems like challenging neural computational problem. -
Yeah, yeah. coming linguistic world, even just regular neurobiology
world, going back something said separate language module
brain. know, thought hypothesis language module
complex algorithms them. signaling speech circuit,
produce sounds, hand circuit, write gesture, visual pathway
interpret reading auditory pathway listening. don't think
case, right. know, thinking internal
speech going on. think going explain asking about,
going take perspective, reading something. read something
paper. signal paper goes eyes. goes back
brain, visual cortical regions eventually. now got interpret
signal visual pathway reading. going
terms speech? visual signal goes speech pathway motor
cortex front here, Broca's area. silently speak read brain
without moving muscles. sometimes actually, put electrodes, EEG, EMG
electrodes laryngeal muscles, even birds, can this, see activity
reading trying speak silently, even though no sound's coming out.
speech pathway now speaking reading. Now finish off,
signal sent auditory pathways can hear speaking
head. - incredible. - complicated using like
three different pathways, visual, speaking motor one, auditory read.
Oh, got write, right? Okay, comes fourth one. Now hand
areas next speech pathway got take auditory signal even
adjacent motor signals speaking translate visual signal paper. So,
using least four brain circuits, includes speech production
speech perception pathways write. - Incredible. finally, explain why,
weaned teaching undergraduates, graduate students medical students
observed teaching, stop speaking going write something
board. just stop speaking completely. - [Erich] Right. - turns
advantage catch allows catch voice. allows slow


bit, know, breathe inhale oxygen tend
speak quickly not writing something out. break circuitry me,
least distinct enough stop write something out.

01:15:13 Writing Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing

- Yes, imply competing brain circuits conscious attention. -
colleagues Columbia Med known, least circles, voice dictating
papers, not writing out, just speaking voice recorder. written
papers way. doesn't feel quite natural writing things out. - Yeah. -
not can go quickly thought language typing. type reasonably fast.
can touch type now. don't think ever taught my, think taught myself. never took
touch typing course. just sort happened. Now, think, motor system seems
know keys enough accuracy, works. remarkable
us can this. comes writing, found
rate thought rate writing aligned nicely, things go well. However,
thinking much faster can write, problem. certainly, thinking
slowly want write, also problem. solution
write pen. love these. no relationship company,
least not now, although want come, know, want work us,
love Pilot V5, V7's not necessarily ink feel, although
like well. rate allows write, write well
slowly, write well quickly. theory, supported
anecdata, no peer reviewed study, writing hand fundamentally different
typing information. evidence motor pathway writing
better somehow different motor pathway typing? - Yeah, interesting.
don't know studies. personal experience well, trying
put context, to, know, design experiment test
hypothesis that, know, explain experience mine, writing
hand, argue, requires different set less skills fingers typing.
coordinate fingers opposite directions forth typing,
also writing hand requires arm movement. therefore, argue
difficulty types muscles fine motor control
need muscles along speaking brain time. -


basically, course, brute. makes sense have,
primitive writing device work. - right, yes. But, let answer terms
personal experience, right. find can write something faster hand
short period time, compared typing. think run
energy arm movements faster run muscle energy finger
movements. think takes longer time us write words fingers,
because, terms speech. think writing, whether hand
typing speech, will align well can type fast can
speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,

speak write fast can speak head. - love it. done,
understand correctly, created bridge thought writing, bridge
speech. - bridge speech, right. right. writing something
out, speaking yourself. speaking faster can type,
got problem. - Interesting. number podcast episodes not
guests, solo episodes. listeners know, long episodes, often
two hours. joke around podcast studio will get locked
mode speech collaborative anecdotal punch
simple declarative sentences. find hard switch one module
next. thing done order make transition fluid prep
podcast episodes actually read lyrics songs sing
head way warming vocal chords. luckily around me,
that, not actually singing loud. this, telling supports
idea even imagining singing writing mind, exercising
vocal chords. - actually getting little low potentials electrical currents
reaching muscles there, also means exercising speech brain
circuits too, without actually, know, going full-blown activity muscles. -
Incredible. - Yeah. idea singing helps well. Even Parkinson's
patients forth, want say something, singing listening music
helps move better. idea brain circuits singing,
say function brain circuits speech used singing first
ancestral trait. easier things singing

01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations

sometimes speaking. - love it. Stutter particularly interesting case


one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.

one every while, get questions audience. Stutter
complicated number ways, culturally, understanding
emails receive stutter can often cause people hide speak less
can embarrassing. often not patient stutter. also
assumption somebody's stuttering, thinking slow, turns
many examples, historically people not speak well,
brilliant thinkers. don't know well write, found modes
communication. realize not speech pathologist therapist,
current neurobiological understanding stutter and, developed terms
treatments stutter? - Yeah, actually accidentally came across stuttering
songbirds. published several papers try figure
neurobiological basis. first study brain area called basal ganglio,
striatum part basal ganglia involved coordinating movements, learning
make movements, damaged speech-like pathway birds,
found started stutter brain region recovered. unlike
humans, actually recovered three four months. case?
bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis way human mammal
brains don't. new neurons coming circuit, not
quite, know, right proper activity resulting stuttering,
birds. repaired, not exactly old song came back repair,
still recovered lot better. now known, call neurogenic stuttering
humans, damage basal ganglia type disruption basal ganglia
young age, also causes stuttering humans. even born
stuttering, often basal ganglia disrupted brain circuit
think speech part basal ganglia. - Can adults maintain stutter
childhood repair stutter? - can repair therapy, learning
speak slower, learning tap rhythm. yeah, not speech pathologist,
started reading literature talking others, know, colleagues
actually study stuttering. yes, ways overcome stuttering through,
know, behavioral therapy. think tools something
sensory motor integration, controlling hear output thoughtful
controlled way helps reduce stuttering. - couple examples real life
want touch on, one somewhat facetious, now realize, serious
neurobiological issue, serious meaning think interesting. every


while, will conversation somebody says last word sentence
along me. seems annoying instances, guessing just
breakthrough motor pattern hearing saying well.
going interpret kindly think hearing saying. literally
hearing mind getting low-level electrical activity throat.
just joining enunciation saying, probably without
realizing it. Can assume might case? - Well, wouldn't surprised
that, know, motor theory speech perception idea originally
came, hear going speech circuit also activating
muscles slightly. yes, one might argue, okay, speech circuit now
interpreting person speaking? Now, listening going
finish off already going brain can predict it?
one theory. don't think verdict known, one.
synchronizing turn-taking conversation acknowledging
understand finishing off say. almost like social
bonding kind thing. be, want person shut can speak
well take turn. pair people rhythm conversation.
somebody talkative versus talkative vice versa,
rhythm can lost finishing ideas going back forth. think
something turn-taking, well, makes lot sense. - colleague
Stanford says interruption sign interest. [Erich laughs] not sure
everyone agrees. think highly contextual. - [Erich] Yes. - form
verbal nod saying, hmm hmm things sort. many these.
often told audience, know, interrupt guests things
sort. Oftentimes, just get caught natural flow conversation, but. - Right.
Well, think pretty good turn-taking here, hope. - far good. - feel
way. - glad feel way, especially context discussion

01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & Future

language. - Yes. - seems important. Texting very, interesting evolution
language told us thought, translated
language. might not complete sentences, texting, imagine
first time human evolution written thumbs. don't know,


seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack
impulse control. high-level academics, not going point fingers anyone.
examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands
people retweets particular cut paste function screenshot
function often reason speech propagates. - [Erich] Yep. - me,
little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.
downturn, know, unintended negative consequence short-term, mean, short-
word communications. - Yeah, agree whole phenomenon netting
people normally say things loud inside door
home. - Right. - not all. - [Erich] Right. - interesting time in.
speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes

bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons
learn dance.

01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description

busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain

seems primitive typing fingers writing hands, hey,
judge evolution species one direction other?
shorthand grammatically, often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
texting incredible thing see. Early relationships, romantic relationships, people
will often evaluate others text ability use proper grammar spelling, et
cetera. often quickly degrades. acceptance just trying
communicate shorthand, almost military like shorthand, internally
consistent people, no general consensus things mean, but,
know, WTFs like, OMGs sorts things. - [Erich] Right. - wonder
sometimes whether not getting less proficient speech not
required write think complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. - not
judgemental here. see colleagues. see myself. not judgment
younger generation. also know slang existed decades, not
hundreds years. also know don't speak way
teenager, suppressed lot slang, not inappropriate
offensive, although was, frankly, context.
think's happening language? getting better speaking, worse
speaking? think role things like texting tweeting
shorthand communication, hashtagging, way brains
work? - Yeah, think that, well, one, terms of, know, measuring level
sophistication intelligence say OMG, right. think also
cultural thing that, ah, belong next generation. an, know,
cool, older person, know, using OMG things
the, know, younger generation use. really think clearly, texting
actually allowed rapid communication amongst people. think, without
invention phone then, or, know, texting back forth, wait
days letter show up. couldn't call somebody phone talk well,
know? rapid communication terms rapid communication
writing case. think actually, like use lose kind thing
brain. use particular brain region circuit, enhanced.
like muscle. exercise it, healthier is, bigger becomes
space takes lose something else. think texting
not decreasing speech prowess, intellectual prowess speech. converting
using lot different way, way may not rich regular writing,


can communicate much nuance short-term writing, whatever
done, got people texting hours hours hours phone.
whatever, thumb circuit going get pretty big, actually. [laughs] - wonder
whether, know, many people lost jobs based tweets. - [Erich] Hmm
hmm. - short latency thought action distribution one's thoughts
incredible. - Yes. - not just talking people apparently
poor prefrontal top-down control. geek speak way, people lack

examples see tweets go, thinking? - Yep. -
presumably, optimal strategy thought speech motor pathway,
especially motor pathway engages communication hundreds thousands

little eerie that, just neural circuitry can catching
little bit slowly technology, got casualties mismatch.
- think good adjective used, casualties, know, going on,
yes, case texting, really losing less
ability write, ability interpret written. can
interpret something somebody means. flip side that, know,
somebody's writing something quick, writing instinctually,
instinctually, true meaning, don't time modify color code
trying say. really feel opposed saying
nuanced way. think sides casualty present.

speech language motor patterns. - part human
evolution language, think part evolution. - right. - Yeah. -
thinking terrible thoughts, please put world
casualty. not, please careful proficient
thought language motor action goes. - [Erich] Yes. [laughs] - Maybe
technology companies install buffers, AI-based buffers. - Right,
taking EEG signals brain texting say, okay, not


great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving

- [Erich] Yes. - people can use imagination. definitely want get
opportunity talk newer work right now
genomes animals. perhaps can tell quite authentic facial expressions,
adore animal kingdom. just find amazing. reason went
neurobiology, part. many animals, many different patterns movement,
many body plans, many specializations, value learning genomes
animals? know, can think conservation-based, know, schemes
trying preserve precious critters, genomes
animals? want understand brain circuits?
relate discussion now? - Yeah,
gotten heavily involved genomes, know, not just get individual
gene involved trade interest, like spoken language, realize that, know,
nature done natural experiments us species
various traits one studying, like vocal learning, evolved multiple
times among animal kingdom, even rare, multiple times. similar
genetic changes occurred species. find genetic changes
associated trait interests not trait like flying birds,
opposed singing, called comparative genomics, even
context studying brain. need genomes compare genomes
like GWA, genome-wide association study, not just within species like humans,
across species. need good genomes that. Plus, discovered
also interested evolution origins. species come similar trait
last, know, 300 million years 60 million years, depending talking
about. need good phylogenetic tree that, get good phylogenetic
tree, also need genomes. so, this, got involved large scale
consortiums produce genomes many different species, including vocal learners
closest relatives fans of. couldn't convince funding agencies


gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,

great thought, slow down. - Right, doesn't reflect best state. brings
going next question anyway, quickly moving
toward time will even faster transition thought speech,
motor output, maybe won't require motor output. referring
incredible work colleagues, Eddie Chang UCSF others
taking paralyzed human beings learning translate electrical signals neurons
various areas, including speech language areas, computer screens type
people thinking. words, paralyzed people can put
thoughts writing. pretty extreme wonderful example recovery
function. - Hmm hmm. - sure continue evolve. think headed
toward time, not long now thoughts can translated words
page allow happen. - Yeah so, Eddie Chang's work, admire quite
bit cite papers, think really one leading edge trying
understand within humans, neurobiology speech. may not say directly,
know, talked this. supports idea speech circuit
separate language module, don't really think separation there.
knowledge, yes, putting electrodes human brain translating
electrical signals speech currents. Yeah, can start tell person
thinking? Why, often think terms speech. without saying words.
scary thought. now imagine can now translate signal
transmits something wirelessly someone distant part planet
hearing speech wireless signal without speaking. probably won't
done ethical way, knows, know? mean, ethics
probably, know, might not happen, knows? songbirds,
know. apply technique them, can start hear singing
dreams whatever, even though don't produce sound can find
testing them.

01:36:26 Movement: Link Cognitive Growth

- coming. - Yes. - One way another, coming. listening
interested getting better speaking understanding languages, tools
recommend? again, realize not speech therapist,
not thinking ameliorating kind speech deficiency. thinking,


instance, recommend people read different types writing?
recommend people learn dance order become better expressing
verbally? know, feel free degrees freedom
answer. obviously not peer-reviewed studies referring to, although
may be, struck number things exceedingly well,
can't help ask, well, singing, realize may, brother didn't pay
say this, may not quite good brothers yet, getting, surpass him,
guessing point. ♪ Getting ♪ - Getting there. [both laughing] Exactly,
go. know, kids learn dance read hard books
simple books? recommend? adults learn that? Everyone
wants know keep brain working better, speak. also think
people want able speak well people want able understand well. -
Yeah, discovered personally, right, that, switched pursuing
career science career dance, thought one day stop dancing,
haven't find fulfilling me, know, just life experience. ever
since started college, know, late teens early twenties, kept dancing even
till day. there've periods time, like pandemic slowed
dancing forth. that, realize, okay, parts
body muscle tone decreases little bit somewhat,
start gain weight. somehow don't gain weight easily. think related
dance, meaningful audience. found is, know, science,
like think separation movement action cognition.
separation perception production, cognition perception,
production moving, right. speech pathways next movement
pathways, discover dancing, helping think. helping keeping
brain fresh. not just moving muscles, moving using circuitry brain
control whole big body. need lot brain tissue that. argue,
want stay cognitively intact old age, better moving better
consistently, whether dancing, walking, running, also practicing
speech, oratory speech forth singing, controlling brain circuits
moving facial musculature. going keep cognitive circuits also
tune. convinced personal experience. - Yeah, me, long,
slow runs wonderful way kind loosen joints long podcasts, especially
solo podcast, can take many hours record. without long slow


runs, least day before, even morning of, don't think it, least
not well. - right, well, experiencing something similar. N two.
- Yeah, N two. tempted learn dance lot reasons

gimme money just project. get whole bunch
people together want study various traits, know, heart disease, loss
gain flight forth, suddenly need lots genomes this. now
got project lead something called Vertebrate Genomes Project
eventually sequence 70,000 species planet. Earth BioGenome Project,
eukaryotic species, two million them. no longer situation
wish genome. Now genetic code life planet, create
database traits find genetic association everything
makes difference one species another. One piece equation add
story didn't realize neuroscientist genomes not
incomplete, lots errors them, false gene duplications, mother
father chromosomes different other, genome algorithm,
assembly algorithms treated two different genes part chromosome.
lot false duplicated genes people thought real,
not missing parts genome enzymes used sequence
DNA couldn't get regulatory region folded made hard
sequence. ended consortiums pulling genome sequencing
companies, developing technology work us improve
computer science guys take data technology, try make
complete genomes make algorithms better produce now just
recently led effort Adam Phillippy first human Telomere-to-Telomere
Genome no errors, complete, no missing sequence. now trying
thing vertebrates species. Actually, improved
got the, call telomere-to-telomere, one end chromosome
another. discovering dark matter genome
missing before, turns regulatory regions specialized vocal
learning species think involved developing speech circuits. - Incredible.
Well, much learn. going learn information. Early
genome projects connectome projects, confess little bit cynical.
10, 15 years ago. thought, okay, necessary, not sufficient anything.
need it, not clear going happen, just gave clear example
stand learn kind information. know conservation
side, huge interest even though prefer keep
species alive rather clone them, sorts projects offer possibility


potentially recreating species lost. - [Erich] Right. - Due
ignorance missteps, you. - Yes, along lines, because,
know, got involved genomics, first species start working
critically endangered species. not for, know,
perspectives understand brains genes involved brain function,
feel like moral duty. fact now become involved genome
biology helped develop tools complete genomes, capture
genetic code now, gone. use information
resurrect species future time, not lifetime, time future
generations ahead us. so, anticipation that, create database,
call GenomeArk no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant store genetic
code complete genome assemblies possible species planet
used basic science, also point future. that, funding
agencies private foundations interested conservation reaching
now, neuroscientist, help producing high quality genome data
endangered species can use, like Revive & Restore, want resurrect
passenger pigeon Colossal, wants resurrect wooly mammoth.
producing high quality genomes groups, conservation projects. -
terrific important initiative. think listening today, now
certainly understand value deeply understanding brain structures
genomes different species. confess, even though knew bit
songbird literature, certainly understand humans speech language,
no idea much convergence function, structure genomes.
me, know, feel lot like ape songbird. - Right. - yet
understanding lot similarity

01:48:24 Evolution Skin & Fur Color

songbirds humans certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something
close home us humans, can give example evolution skin
color. skin color, use unfortunately, racism forth. use also
good things let light let less light depending part planet,
know, population evolved in. people think dark-skinned people
evolved dark-skinned person light-skinned people evolved


light-skinned person, not case. Dark skin light skin amongst
humans evolved independently multiple times, like in, know, Pacific islands
versus Africa. just depending angle light hitting Earth whether
need protection sun less protection, also associated
Vitamin D synthesis skin. so, time, darker lighter skin
evolved independently, hit gene, know, mela [finger snaps]. -
Melanin. - Melanin receptors. right, yes, yeah. Genes involved melanin
formation. genes evolve mutations, even different
species. not just humans. equatorial regions, darker-skinned animals
going away equator. - Oh, right, think Arctic foxes things sort. -
Yep, right. right, polar bears, know, genes
used evolutionary perspective evolve similar way within across species. -
Incredible. - Yeah. thing happening brain too. Language no
exception. - Well, say, somebody a, know, career neuroscientist,
mentioned several times now, also adores animal kingdom, also
obsessed speech language, distance not practitioner music
dance, incredible conversation opportunity learn.
know speak tremendous number people just really want say, thank
joining us today. incredibly busy. clear description
science knowledge base, involved huge number things,
busy, thank taking time speak us. Thank work
doing, speech language, also important work
genomes conservation endangered species far more. say,
agree come back speak us sometime, certain
sit even six months year now, going lot
come. - Yeah, things cooking thank inviting get
word community going science world. - Well,
honored grateful you, Erich.
