00:07:40 Sugar & Brain

Just use code Huberman checkout. Okay, talk sugar, talk
sugar impacts brain, brain impacts pursuit
avoidance sugar. get things way first. first thing
nothing inherently bad sugar. know word sugar gets bad rap
nowadays, indeed, going hear again, podcast,
consuming lot refined sugars, particular high fructose corn syrup, known


large number bad effects brain body. don't know
anyone really debates anymore. Even just agree, think
agree, so-called calories in, calories principle, right? principle
thermodynamics ingest energy burn, going gain
weight. ingest less energy burn, generally going lose weight.
two things balance, ingestion burning energy, well,
going maintain weight. everyone agrees that, agree that. beyond,
number ways particular nutrients, case today's episode, sugar,
impact way brain works, tend seek particular
nutrients. instance, eat sugar, two, least two mechanisms,
will crave sugar. think people aware experience,
today going explain exactly works. also ingest sugar
bunch different effects way neural circuits work can allow us
less focused, less agitated, less happy, less
depressed cases. today, explore thing calling sugar,
going explore mainly context nervous system, also context
nervous system regulates many, many functions behaviors
important you, ability think, ability extra size, ability gain
weight, lose weight, whatever goals might happen be, sugar plays critical role
achieving goals. cases, ingesting much wrong
times wrong forms, sugar can actually impede goals. fact, sugar can
prevent right behaviors allowing achieve goals want.
today going place sugar proper context. way want start off


00:10:06 Appetite & Hormones: Ghrelin & Insulin

tell little bit happens eat little bit brain
respond events. happens eat? Well, done
entire episode metabolism. interested full cascade hormonal
neural events occurs eat, please check episode. sake
today's discussion, just take a, call top contour view hormonal
response ingesting food. Now, anytime eat, consequence number
things happened ate. brain body called Ghrelin,


spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin hormone increases depending long
since ate last. longer since meal, Ghrelin levels
going higher higher higher, essentially makes us hungry
interacting particular neurons area brain called arcuate nucleus
hypothalamus areas well, like lateral hypothalamus. don't
need know names brain areas, like know them,
Ghrelin increases, tends make us hungry. eat, typically
happens Ghrelin levels go down. logical system. Now, eat,
assuming eat carbohydrates, even just eat protein fats,
will experience slight, cases, large rise blood glucose, blood
glucose simply blood sugar. body brain, say particular,
nervous system doesn't function well blood sugar high low.
consequence, another hormone, released pancreas,
called insulin, helps regulate amount glucose bloodstream. even
ingest entire cup, eight ounce cup pure table sugar,
send blood glucose very, high, assuming normal insulin
response, not diabetic, insulin response help clamp blood
glucose level not cause damage brain body. blood
sugar goes high, actually toxic neurons cells body, can kill
off. neurons central nervous system, meaning brain spinal cord,
dead, not come back. biological systems understand
biological level is, prevent death cells due high blood sugar,
keeping insulin around, order clamp blood glucose. Diabetics, call type
one diabetics, don't make insulin, take insulin eat particular,
eat foods raise blood sugar, specifically avoid neurotoxicity
deleterious effects high blood sugar. Ghrelin hormone goes
longer since eaten, tends stimulate hunger. eat,
Ghrelin suppressed. Blood glucose typically goes up, especially eat
carbohydrate containing meal. blood glucose goes up, regulated body,
meaning peaks valleys less smoothed out, glucose
sequestered, taken away needs taken away. certain locations,
delivered cells cells can use glucose. Now, one chief
organs glucose utilization brain, neurons tremendously metabolically active.
preferred mode metabolism glucose metabolism. words, neurons


basically run sugar, not say eat lot sugar.
see today, states mind body, instance, fasted states, people
report immense amounts mental clarity blood glucose actually
quite low. simply not case sugar ingest, better
brain will function. case people, meaning people
not ketogenic low carbohydrate diet, not adapted low
carbohydrate diets, neurons brain body using glucose order
function. allows neurons fire electrical potentials,
refer it, firing, meaning sending electrical signals length communicate
neurons.

00:14:17 Glucose & Brain Function

illustrate just important glucose brain function, like describe study
just recently came out, sits long history similar studies. one
just came particularly interesting. Now want point that, unless say
otherwise, going refer typical diets, meaning believe people
ingesting starch starch carbohydrate. realize
people following low carbohydrate diets moderately carbohydrate diets.
even know folks so-called carnivore diet,
eat meat organs, maybe little fruit. going assume vast
majority people listening ingest proteins carbohydrates. unless say
ketogenic, emphasize ketosis itself, will, referring kind typical diet
people consuming fats, proteins carbohydrates. count one
individual. point might try carnivore diet, knows, might pure
vegan diet, knows. entire life now, 46 years old,
proud omnivore, meaning tried eat high quality much can, unprocessed
foods, try really avoid highly processed foods. eat three
macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, going assume
well. study like emphasize, recorded neurons, nerve
cells, brain, particular part brain `that responds visual images,
called visual cortex. neurons visual cortex beautifully tuned,
say, particular features see. primary example this, kind
classic example, put little electrode next neuron visual cortex,


put FMRI scanner machine, can detect neural activity,
show bunch just little lines, bars light, dark bars light,
light bars light, screen front you. vertical,
horizontal, 45 degrees, see
neurons respond best, meaning fire lot electrical activity vertical lines,
ones respond horizontal lines, others respond 45 degree lines.
called orientation tuning, meaning orientation line, cardinal
classic feature way visual system built. everything see,
whether face dog cat landscape, built simple
neuron responses. words, look face, neurons deep
brain respond faces. reason neurons can respond
faces receive signals neurons visual cortex.
respond vertical lines, respond horizontal lines,
respond 45 degree lines. built call
hierarchical representation, just fancy language building blocks
see face recognize face. really amazing
phenomenon, happens very, fast. never notice this,
everything built fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now
orientation-tuned neurons fundamental building blocks
make things see, way read, way
recognize faces, mentioned, everything else. Experimentally, quite
straightforward measure sharply tuned one neurons is. words,
show vertical line find neuron brain responds vertical
lines, also ask whether not neuron fires electrical activity response
line not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical 20 degrees 30
degrees. eventually find neuron orientation-tuned
particular range angles. not going respond vertical lines, also going
respond lines 10 degrees off vertical either side, probably not
much more, maybe 20, usually going anywhere vertical just tilted
slightly. recent experiment published journal, "Neuron," Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, authors asked really interesting question, asked
whether not sharpness tuning, precision orientation tuning
neurons dependent blood glucose level. just cut chase, give
answer, found subjects well fed, neurons responded


vertical, responded strongly vertical, not much angles,
call stimuli, lines 10 degrees 20 degrees off. looked
neurons primarily tuned, right, preferred horizontal lines, found
thing. wasn't something unique vertical lines. basically found
sharpness, precision tuning neurons brain, best
subjects fed. conversely, subjects fasted, orientation tuning
neurons became much broader. meant neuron normally
respond vertical now responded angles lines well. might
say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems
appetite works best, given schedule, et cetera. morning, tend
focused. always associated fact fasted. ingest
water caffeine 90 minutes waking up, drink caffeine,
hydrate time get up, et cetera, et cetera. know lot people
experience fasted feeling like lot mental clarity.
fasted state, typically going use fuels available
neurons, based intake food day before, maybe using
glycogen, maybe using fat, maybe using blood sugar,
derived storage sites body. don't actually use fat fuel source
neurons typical conditions. ways proteins fats
glycogen, et cetera, converted fuel neurons can use. interesting
study study says well fed, meaning blood glucose,
sugar, properly elevated level bloodstream, can delivered brain
way allows neurons work best, really just underscore point
made earlier, nervous system extremely metabolically


demanding, loves glucose, neurons love glucose. takeaway study
not avoid fasting, takeaway study
elements fasted state particular elevations things like epinephrine
norepinephrine, also called adrenaline noradrenaline, can give us kind
clarity mind many people pursuing fast. kind one
reasons lot people fast, like way feel, mentally physically.
think fair point glucose preferred source fuel brain.
study mentioned one many studies explored nutritional
status blood glucose status brain body influence neuronal tuning
neuronal function. really points fact ultimately, brain organ,
glucose consuming machine. Now, eat food, food broken
contains carbohydrates, going converted glucose. glucose
can't get directly brain fuel source. actually carried across
so-called blood brain barrier, BBB, actual metabolism glucose
delivery glucose neurons carried different cell type. cell
type know abundant cell type
brain, maybe even entire nervous system, so-called astrocyte.
Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal
function brain plasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
astrocytes like little waiters waitresses bringing glucose neurons
neurons going heavy lifting involved perception
behavior action. prior episode, didn't already realize glucose,
blood sugar, vital function brain neurons nervous
system, now know. experienced increase
mental clarity comes properly timed, properly composed, meaning
right macronutrients right ratios, properly sized meal, well now
justification eating something way improve way brain
works. turns brain going work best got glucose available,
whether like fast not, just reality things.

00:24:19 Glucose & Physical Activity



thing also true neurons body. way able
move limbs body, way able perform exercise movement
kind matter, neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical
potentials muscle fibers, release neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,
causes contraction muscle fibers, allows move limbs.
neurons also metabolically demanding, especially
demanding types physical work, cycling running weightlifting
yoga whatever may be. neurons require ton glucose. ever
experience think hard generating movement
force continue endure given exercise, might thought, oh,
know, running fuel, getting tired, hard do. actually
case sometimes, not always case. One reasons feels like
work called upper motor neurons, ones control lower
motor neurons spinal cord, control muscles,
metabolically active. one thing engage reflexive movement just
walking around running continuously. suddenly focus
doing, generate specific patterns motor movement,
well, feels demanding one, increases release adrenaline
brain body, makes feel little bit agitated alert, also
deliberate thought, deliberately controlling way brain body moving,
requires glucose uptake, energy neurons. also
long exercise, might tired, also skill
learning kind, reading thinking reading,
intense conversation somebody really forcing
listen, hopefully listening too, really trying parse
saying, maybe right now, trying really track
something, work,

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose


provides bridge us particular kind sugar, hormone function,

00:32:41 Eat High-Sugar Foods?

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,
understand way work,

Neuroscience, papers Neuron, Cell Press journals, et cetera, many, many journals,
many, many papers. subjects given choice drinking plain water sweet
tasting fluid, preference sweet tasting fluid much, much higher, right?
Sweet tastes better plain water, least people certainly animals.
Now, if, instance, take animal completely lacks sweet receptors,
can molecular genetic tools gymnastics laboratory,
call knockout mice, can knock particular receptor sweet
taste, can confirm no perception sweet things least no

Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez Duke University. cells respond to,
among things, presence sugar within gut. ingest sugary

00:07:40 Sugar & Brain

Just use code Huberman checkout. Okay, talk sugar, talk
sugar impacts brain, brain impacts pursuit
avoidance sugar. get things way first. first thing
nothing inherently bad sugar. know word sugar gets bad rap
nowadays, indeed, going hear again, podcast,
consuming lot refined sugars, particular high fructose corn syrup, known


large number bad effects brain body. don't know
anyone really debates anymore. Even just agree, think
agree, so-called calories in, calories principle, right? principle
thermodynamics ingest energy burn, going gain
weight. ingest less energy burn, generally going lose weight.
two things balance, ingestion burning energy, well,
going maintain weight. everyone agrees that, agree that. beyond,
number ways particular nutrients, case today's episode, sugar,
impact way brain works, tend seek particular
nutrients. instance, eat sugar, two, least two mechanisms,
will crave sugar. think people aware experience,
today going explain exactly works. also ingest sugar
bunch different effects way neural circuits work can allow us
less focused, less agitated, less happy, less
depressed cases. today, explore thing calling sugar,
going explore mainly context nervous system, also context
nervous system regulates many, many functions behaviors
important you, ability think, ability extra size, ability gain
weight, lose weight, whatever goals might happen be, sugar plays critical role
achieving goals. cases, ingesting much wrong
times wrong forms, sugar can actually impede goals. fact, sugar can
prevent right behaviors allowing achieve goals want.
today going place sugar proper context. way want start off


00:10:06 Appetite & Hormones: Ghrelin & Insulin

tell little bit happens eat little bit brain
respond events. happens eat? Well, done
entire episode metabolism. interested full cascade hormonal
neural events occurs eat, please check episode. sake
today's discussion, just take a, call top contour view hormonal
response ingesting food. Now, anytime eat, consequence number
things happened ate. brain body called Ghrelin,


spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin hormone increases depending long
since ate last. longer since meal, Ghrelin levels
going higher higher higher, essentially makes us hungry
interacting particular neurons area brain called arcuate nucleus
hypothalamus areas well, like lateral hypothalamus. don't
need know names brain areas, like know them,
Ghrelin increases, tends make us hungry. eat, typically
happens Ghrelin levels go down. logical system. Now, eat,
assuming eat carbohydrates, even just eat protein fats,
will experience slight, cases, large rise blood glucose, blood
glucose simply blood sugar. body brain, say particular,
nervous system doesn't function well blood sugar high low.
consequence, another hormone, released pancreas,
called insulin, helps regulate amount glucose bloodstream. even
ingest entire cup, eight ounce cup pure table sugar,
send blood glucose very, high, assuming normal insulin
response, not diabetic, insulin response help clamp blood
glucose level not cause damage brain body. blood
sugar goes high, actually toxic neurons cells body, can kill
off. neurons central nervous system, meaning brain spinal cord,
dead, not come back. biological systems understand
biological level is, prevent death cells due high blood sugar,
keeping insulin around, order clamp blood glucose. Diabetics, call type
one diabetics, don't make insulin, take insulin eat particular,
eat foods raise blood sugar, specifically avoid neurotoxicity
deleterious effects high blood sugar. Ghrelin hormone goes
longer since eaten, tends stimulate hunger. eat,
Ghrelin suppressed. Blood glucose typically goes up, especially eat
carbohydrate containing meal. blood glucose goes up, regulated body,
meaning peaks valleys less smoothed out, glucose
sequestered, taken away needs taken away. certain locations,
delivered cells cells can use glucose. Now, one chief
organs glucose utilization brain, neurons tremendously metabolically active.
preferred mode metabolism glucose metabolism. words, neurons


basically run sugar, not say eat lot sugar.
see today, states mind body, instance, fasted states, people
report immense amounts mental clarity blood glucose actually
quite low. simply not case sugar ingest, better
brain will function. case people, meaning people
not ketogenic low carbohydrate diet, not adapted low
carbohydrate diets, neurons brain body using glucose order
function. allows neurons fire electrical potentials,
refer it, firing, meaning sending electrical signals length communicate
neurons.

00:14:17 Glucose & Brain Function

illustrate just important glucose brain function, like describe study
just recently came out, sits long history similar studies. one
just came particularly interesting. Now want point that, unless say
otherwise, going refer typical diets, meaning believe people
ingesting starch starch carbohydrate. realize
people following low carbohydrate diets moderately carbohydrate diets.
even know folks so-called carnivore diet,
eat meat organs, maybe little fruit. going assume vast
majority people listening ingest proteins carbohydrates. unless say
ketogenic, emphasize ketosis itself, will, referring kind typical diet
people consuming fats, proteins carbohydrates. count one
individual. point might try carnivore diet, knows, might pure
vegan diet, knows. entire life now, 46 years old,
proud omnivore, meaning tried eat high quality much can, unprocessed
foods, try really avoid highly processed foods. eat three
macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, going assume
well. study like emphasize, recorded neurons, nerve
cells, brain, particular part brain `that responds visual images,
called visual cortex. neurons visual cortex beautifully tuned,
say, particular features see. primary example this, kind
classic example, put little electrode next neuron visual cortex,


put FMRI scanner machine, can detect neural activity,
show bunch just little lines, bars light, dark bars light,
light bars light, screen front you. vertical,
horizontal, 45 degrees, see
neurons respond best, meaning fire lot electrical activity vertical lines,
ones respond horizontal lines, others respond 45 degree lines.
called orientation tuning, meaning orientation line, cardinal
classic feature way visual system built. everything see,
whether face dog cat landscape, built simple
neuron responses. words, look face, neurons deep
brain respond faces. reason neurons can respond
faces receive signals neurons visual cortex.
respond vertical lines, respond horizontal lines,
respond 45 degree lines. built call
hierarchical representation, just fancy language building blocks
see face recognize face. really amazing
phenomenon, happens very, fast. never notice this,
everything built fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now
orientation-tuned neurons fundamental building blocks
make things see, way read, way
recognize faces, mentioned, everything else. Experimentally, quite
straightforward measure sharply tuned one neurons is. words,
show vertical line find neuron brain responds vertical
lines, also ask whether not neuron fires electrical activity response
line not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical 20 degrees 30
degrees. eventually find neuron orientation-tuned
particular range angles. not going respond vertical lines, also going
respond lines 10 degrees off vertical either side, probably not
much more, maybe 20, usually going anywhere vertical just tilted
slightly. recent experiment published journal, "Neuron," Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, authors asked really interesting question, asked
whether not sharpness tuning, precision orientation tuning
neurons dependent blood glucose level. just cut chase, give
answer, found subjects well fed, neurons responded


vertical, responded strongly vertical, not much angles,
call stimuli, lines 10 degrees 20 degrees off. looked
neurons primarily tuned, right, preferred horizontal lines, found
thing. wasn't something unique vertical lines. basically found
sharpness, precision tuning neurons brain, best
subjects fed. conversely, subjects fasted, orientation tuning
neurons became much broader. meant neuron normally
respond vertical now responded angles lines well. might
say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems
appetite works best, given schedule, et cetera. morning, tend
focused. always associated fact fasted. ingest
water caffeine 90 minutes waking up, drink caffeine,
hydrate time get up, et cetera, et cetera. know lot people
experience fasted feeling like lot mental clarity.
fasted state, typically going use fuels available
neurons, based intake food day before, maybe using
glycogen, maybe using fat, maybe using blood sugar,
derived storage sites body. don't actually use fat fuel source
neurons typical conditions. ways proteins fats
glycogen, et cetera, converted fuel neurons can use. interesting
study study says well fed, meaning blood glucose,
sugar, properly elevated level bloodstream, can delivered brain
way allows neurons work best, really just underscore point
made earlier, nervous system extremely metabolically


demanding, loves glucose, neurons love glucose. takeaway study
not avoid fasting, takeaway study
elements fasted state particular elevations things like epinephrine
norepinephrine, also called adrenaline noradrenaline, can give us kind
clarity mind many people pursuing fast. kind one
reasons lot people fast, like way feel, mentally physically.
think fair point glucose preferred source fuel brain.
study mentioned one many studies explored nutritional
status blood glucose status brain body influence neuronal tuning
neuronal function. really points fact ultimately, brain organ,
glucose consuming machine. Now, eat food, food broken
contains carbohydrates, going converted glucose. glucose
can't get directly brain fuel source. actually carried across
so-called blood brain barrier, BBB, actual metabolism glucose
delivery glucose neurons carried different cell type. cell
type know abundant cell type
brain, maybe even entire nervous system, so-called astrocyte.
Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal
function brain plasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
astrocytes like little waiters waitresses bringing glucose neurons
neurons going heavy lifting involved perception
behavior action. prior episode, didn't already realize glucose,
blood sugar, vital function brain neurons nervous
system, now know. experienced increase
mental clarity comes properly timed, properly composed, meaning
right macronutrients right ratios, properly sized meal, well now
justification eating something way improve way brain
works. turns brain going work best got glucose available,
whether like fast not, just reality things.

00:24:19 Glucose & Physical Activity



thing also true neurons body. way able
move limbs body, way able perform exercise movement
kind matter, neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical
potentials muscle fibers, release neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,
causes contraction muscle fibers, allows move limbs.
neurons also metabolically demanding, especially
demanding types physical work, cycling running weightlifting
yoga whatever may be. neurons require ton glucose. ever
experience think hard generating movement
force continue endure given exercise, might thought, oh,
know, running fuel, getting tired, hard do. actually
case sometimes, not always case. One reasons feels like
work called upper motor neurons, ones control lower

metabolically active. one thing engage reflexive movement just
walking around running continuously. suddenly focus
doing, generate specific patterns motor movement,
well, feels demanding one, increases release adrenaline
brain body, makes feel little bit agitated alert, also
deliberate thought, deliberately controlling way brain body moving,
requires glucose uptake, energy neurons. also
long exercise, might tired, also skill
learning kind, reading thinking reading,
intense conversation somebody really forcing
listen, hopefully listening too, really trying parse
saying, maybe right now, trying really track
something, work,

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose


provides bridge us particular kind sugar, hormone function,

00:32:41 Eat High-Sugar Foods?

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,
understand way work,

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called
master sleep. can find episode easily hubermanlab.com. available
various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts
metabolism occurring people's bodies different phases sleep.
really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep slow wave, sleep, on. go
deeper study future, interesting, think
important. discovered stage sleep associated
particular signature pattern metabolism particular phases sleep
associated sugar metabolism, fat metabolism,
aspects metabolism. reason think study important discuss
context today's discussion sugar brain, many people
experienced effects disrupted sleep appetite. particular,
reported people sleep deprived quality sleep disrupted,
appetite sugary food increases. Now always assumed due
metabolic need triggered sleep deprivation poor sleep.
reading study, important points made authors
relate fact well, sleep known incredibly important effects brain

large number bad effects brain body. don't know
anyone really debates anymore. Even just agree, think
agree, so-called calories in, calories principle, right? principle
thermodynamics ingest energy burn, going gain
weight. ingest less energy burn, generally going lose weight.
two things balance, ingestion burning energy, well,
going maintain weight. everyone agrees that, agree that. beyond,
number ways particular nutrients, case today's episode, sugar,
impact way brain works, tend seek particular
nutrients. instance, eat sugar, two, least two mechanisms,
will crave sugar. think people aware experience,
today going explain exactly works. also ingest sugar
bunch different effects way neural circuits work can allow us
less focused, less agitated, less happy, less
depressed cases. today, explore thing calling sugar,
going explore mainly context nervous system, also context
nervous system regulates many, many functions behaviors
important you, ability think, ability extra size, ability gain
weight, lose weight, whatever goals might happen be, sugar plays critical role
achieving goals. cases, ingesting much wrong
times wrong forms, sugar can actually impede goals. fact, sugar can
prevent right behaviors allowing achieve goals want.
today going place sugar proper context. way want start off


00:10:06 Appetite & Hormones: Ghrelin & Insulin

tell little bit happens eat little bit brain
respond events. happens eat? Well, done
entire episode metabolism. interested full cascade hormonal
neural events occurs eat, please check episode. sake
today's discussion, just take a, call top contour view hormonal
response ingesting food. Now, anytime eat, consequence number
things happened ate. brain body called Ghrelin,


spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin hormone increases depending long
since ate last. longer since meal, Ghrelin levels
going higher higher higher, essentially makes us hungry
interacting particular neurons area brain called arcuate nucleus
hypothalamus areas well, like lateral hypothalamus. don't
need know names brain areas, like know them,
Ghrelin increases, tends make us hungry. eat, typically
happens Ghrelin levels go down. logical system. Now, eat,
assuming eat carbohydrates, even just eat protein fats,
will experience slight, cases, large rise blood glucose, blood
glucose simply blood sugar. body brain, say particular,
nervous system doesn't function well blood sugar high low.
consequence, another hormone, released pancreas,
called insulin, helps regulate amount glucose bloodstream. even
ingest entire cup, eight ounce cup pure table sugar,
send blood glucose very, high, assuming normal insulin
response, not diabetic, insulin response help clamp blood
glucose level not cause damage brain body. blood
sugar goes high, actually toxic neurons cells body, can kill
off. neurons central nervous system, meaning brain spinal cord,
dead, not come back. biological systems understand
biological level is, prevent death cells due high blood sugar,
keeping insulin around, order clamp blood glucose. Diabetics, call type
one diabetics, don't make insulin, take insulin eat particular,
eat foods raise blood sugar, specifically avoid neurotoxicity
deleterious effects high blood sugar. Ghrelin hormone goes
longer since eaten, tends stimulate hunger. eat,
Ghrelin suppressed. Blood glucose typically goes up, especially eat
carbohydrate containing meal. blood glucose goes up, regulated body,
meaning peaks valleys less smoothed out, glucose
sequestered, taken away needs taken away. certain locations,
delivered cells cells can use glucose. Now, one chief
organs glucose utilization brain, neurons tremendously metabolically active.
preferred mode metabolism glucose metabolism. words, neurons


basically run sugar, not say eat lot sugar.
see today, states mind body, instance, fasted states, people
report immense amounts mental clarity blood glucose actually
quite low. simply not case sugar ingest, better
brain will function. case people, meaning people
not ketogenic low carbohydrate diet, not adapted low
carbohydrate diets, neurons brain body using glucose order
function. allows neurons fire electrical potentials,
refer it, firing, meaning sending electrical signals length communicate
neurons.

00:14:17 Glucose & Brain Function

illustrate just important glucose brain function, like describe study
just recently came out, sits long history similar studies. one
just came particularly interesting. Now want point that, unless say
otherwise, going refer typical diets, meaning believe people
ingesting starch starch carbohydrate. realize
people following low carbohydrate diets moderately carbohydrate diets.
even know folks so-called carnivore diet,
eat meat organs, maybe little fruit. going assume vast
majority people listening ingest proteins carbohydrates. unless say
ketogenic, emphasize ketosis itself, will, referring kind typical diet
people consuming fats, proteins carbohydrates. count one
individual. point might try carnivore diet, knows, might pure
vegan diet, knows. entire life now, 46 years old,
proud omnivore, meaning tried eat high quality much can, unprocessed
foods, try really avoid highly processed foods. eat three
macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, going assume
well. study like emphasize, recorded neurons, nerve
cells, brain, particular part brain `that responds visual images,
called visual cortex. neurons visual cortex beautifully tuned,
say, particular features see. primary example this, kind
classic example, put little electrode next neuron visual cortex,


put FMRI scanner machine, can detect neural activity,
show bunch just little lines, bars light, dark bars light,
light bars light, screen front you. vertical,
horizontal, 45 degrees, see
neurons respond best, meaning fire lot electrical activity vertical lines,
ones respond horizontal lines, others respond 45 degree lines.
called orientation tuning, meaning orientation line, cardinal
classic feature way visual system built. everything see,
whether face dog cat landscape, built simple
neuron responses. words, look face, neurons deep
brain respond faces. reason neurons can respond
faces receive signals neurons visual cortex.
respond vertical lines, respond horizontal lines,
respond 45 degree lines. built call
hierarchical representation, just fancy language building blocks
see face recognize face. really amazing
phenomenon, happens very, fast. never notice this,
everything built fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now
orientation-tuned neurons fundamental building blocks
make things see, way read, way
recognize faces, mentioned, everything else. Experimentally, quite
straightforward measure sharply tuned one neurons is. words,
show vertical line find neuron brain responds vertical
lines, also ask whether not neuron fires electrical activity response
line not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical 20 degrees 30
degrees. eventually find neuron orientation-tuned
particular range angles. not going respond vertical lines, also going
respond lines 10 degrees off vertical either side, probably not
much more, maybe 20, usually going anywhere vertical just tilted
slightly. recent experiment published journal, "Neuron," Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, authors asked really interesting question, asked
whether not sharpness tuning, precision orientation tuning
neurons dependent blood glucose level. just cut chase, give
answer, found subjects well fed, neurons responded


vertical, responded strongly vertical, not much angles,
call stimuli, lines 10 degrees 20 degrees off. looked
neurons primarily tuned, right, preferred horizontal lines, found
thing. wasn't something unique vertical lines. basically found
sharpness, precision tuning neurons brain, best
subjects fed. conversely, subjects fasted, orientation tuning
neurons became much broader. meant neuron normally
respond vertical now responded angles lines well. might
say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems
appetite works best, given schedule, et cetera. morning, tend
focused. always associated fact fasted. ingest
water caffeine 90 minutes waking up, drink caffeine,
hydrate time get up, et cetera, et cetera. know lot people
experience fasted feeling like lot mental clarity.
fasted state, typically going use fuels available
neurons, based intake food day before, maybe using
glycogen, maybe using fat, maybe using blood sugar,
derived storage sites body. don't actually use fat fuel source
neurons typical conditions. ways proteins fats
glycogen, et cetera, converted fuel neurons can use. interesting
study study says well fed, meaning blood glucose,
sugar, properly elevated level bloodstream, can delivered brain
way allows neurons work best, really just underscore point
made earlier, nervous system extremely metabolically


demanding, loves glucose, neurons love glucose. takeaway study
not avoid fasting, takeaway study
elements fasted state particular elevations things like epinephrine
norepinephrine, also called adrenaline noradrenaline, can give us kind
clarity mind many people pursuing fast. kind one
reasons lot people fast, like way feel, mentally physically.
think fair point glucose preferred source fuel brain.
study mentioned one many studies explored nutritional
status blood glucose status brain body influence neuronal tuning
neuronal function. really points fact ultimately, brain organ,
glucose consuming machine. Now, eat food, food broken
contains carbohydrates, going converted glucose. glucose
can't get directly brain fuel source. actually carried across
so-called blood brain barrier, BBB, actual metabolism glucose
delivery glucose neurons carried different cell type. cell
type know abundant cell type
brain, maybe even entire nervous system, so-called astrocyte.
Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal
function brain plasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
astrocytes like little waiters waitresses bringing glucose neurons
neurons going heavy lifting involved perception
behavior action. prior episode, didn't already realize glucose,
blood sugar, vital function brain neurons nervous
system, now know. experienced increase
mental clarity comes properly timed, properly composed, meaning
right macronutrients right ratios, properly sized meal, well now
justification eating something way improve way brain
works. turns brain going work best got glucose available,
whether like fast not, just reality things.

00:24:19 Glucose & Physical Activity



thing also true neurons body. way able
move limbs body, way able perform exercise movement
kind matter, neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical
potentials muscle fibers, release neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,
causes contraction muscle fibers, allows move limbs.
neurons also metabolically demanding, especially
demanding types physical work, cycling running weightlifting
yoga whatever may be. neurons require ton glucose. ever
experience think hard generating movement
force continue endure given exercise, might thought, oh,
know, running fuel, getting tired, hard do. actually
case sometimes, not always case. One reasons feels like
work called upper motor neurons, ones control lower
motor neurons spinal cord, control muscles,
metabolically active. one thing engage reflexive movement just
walking around running continuously. suddenly focus
doing, generate specific patterns motor movement,
well, feels demanding one, increases release adrenaline
brain body, makes feel little bit agitated alert, also
deliberate thought, deliberately controlling way brain body moving,
requires glucose uptake, energy neurons. also
long exercise, might tired, also skill
learning kind, reading thinking reading,
intense conversation somebody really forcing
listen, hopefully listening too, really trying parse
saying, maybe right now, trying really track
something, work,

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose


provides bridge us particular kind sugar, hormone function,

00:32:41 Eat High-Sugar Foods?

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,
understand way work,

Sweet tastes better plain water, least people certainly animals.
Now, if, instance, take animal completely lacks sweet receptors,
can molecular genetic tools gymnastics laboratory,

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits

various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts
metabolism occurring people's bodies different phases sleep.
really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep slow wave, sleep, on. go
deeper study future, interesting, think
important. discovered stage sleep associated

00:14:17 Glucose & Brain Function

illustrate just important glucose brain function, like describe study
just recently came out, sits long history similar studies. one
just came particularly interesting. Now want point that, unless say
otherwise, going refer typical diets, meaning believe people
ingesting starch starch carbohydrate. realize
people following low carbohydrate diets moderately carbohydrate diets.
even know folks so-called carnivore diet,
eat meat organs, maybe little fruit. going assume vast
majority people listening ingest proteins carbohydrates. unless say
ketogenic, emphasize ketosis itself, will, referring kind typical diet
people consuming fats, proteins carbohydrates. count one
individual. point might try carnivore diet, knows, might pure
vegan diet, knows. entire life now, 46 years old,
proud omnivore, meaning tried eat high quality much can, unprocessed
foods, try really avoid highly processed foods. eat three
macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, going assume
well. study like emphasize, recorded neurons, nerve
cells, brain, particular part brain `that responds visual images,
called visual cortex. neurons visual cortex beautifully tuned,
say, particular features see. primary example this, kind
classic example, put little electrode next neuron visual cortex,


put FMRI scanner machine, can detect neural activity,
show bunch just little lines, bars light, dark bars light,
light bars light, screen front you. vertical,
horizontal, 45 degrees, see
neurons respond best, meaning fire lot electrical activity vertical lines,
ones respond horizontal lines, others respond 45 degree lines.
called orientation tuning, meaning orientation line, cardinal
classic feature way visual system built. everything see,
whether face dog cat landscape, built simple
neuron responses. words, look face, neurons deep
brain respond faces. reason neurons can respond
faces receive signals neurons visual cortex.
respond vertical lines, respond horizontal lines,
respond 45 degree lines. built call
hierarchical representation, just fancy language building blocks
see face recognize face. really amazing
phenomenon, happens very, fast. never notice this,
everything built fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now
orientation-tuned neurons fundamental building blocks
make things see, way read, way
recognize faces, mentioned, everything else. Experimentally, quite
straightforward measure sharply tuned one neurons is. words,
show vertical line find neuron brain responds vertical
lines, also ask whether not neuron fires electrical activity response
line not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical 20 degrees 30
degrees. eventually find neuron orientation-tuned
particular range angles. not going respond vertical lines, also going
respond lines 10 degrees off vertical either side, probably not
much more, maybe 20, usually going anywhere vertical just tilted
slightly. recent experiment published journal, "Neuron," Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, authors asked really interesting question, asked
whether not sharpness tuning, precision orientation tuning
neurons dependent blood glucose level. just cut chase, give
answer, found subjects well fed, neurons responded


vertical, responded strongly vertical, not much angles,

respond vertical now responded angles lines well. might
say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems
appetite works best, given schedule, et cetera. morning, tend
focused. always associated fact fasted. ingest
water caffeine 90 minutes waking up, drink caffeine,
hydrate time get up, et cetera, et cetera. know lot people
experience fasted feeling like lot mental clarity.
fasted state, typically going use fuels available
neurons, based intake food day before, maybe using
glycogen, maybe using fat, maybe using blood sugar,
derived storage sites body. don't actually use fat fuel source
neurons typical conditions. ways proteins fats
glycogen, et cetera, converted fuel neurons can use. interesting
study study says well fed, meaning blood glucose,
sugar, properly elevated level bloodstream, can delivered brain
way allows neurons work best, really just underscore point
made earlier, nervous system extremely metabolically


demanding, loves glucose, neurons love glucose. takeaway study
not avoid fasting, takeaway study
elements fasted state particular elevations things like epinephrine
norepinephrine, also called adrenaline noradrenaline, can give us kind
clarity mind many people pursuing fast. kind one
reasons lot people fast, like way feel, mentally physically.
think fair point glucose preferred source fuel brain.
study mentioned one many studies explored nutritional
status blood glucose status brain body influence neuronal tuning
neuronal function. really points fact ultimately, brain organ,
glucose consuming machine. Now, eat food, food broken
contains carbohydrates, going converted glucose. glucose
can't get directly brain fuel source. actually carried across
so-called blood brain barrier, BBB, actual metabolism glucose
delivery glucose neurons carried different cell type. cell

brain, maybe even entire nervous system, so-called astrocyte.
Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal
function brain plasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
astrocytes like little waiters waitresses bringing glucose neurons
neurons going heavy lifting involved perception
behavior action. prior episode, didn't already realize glucose,
blood sugar, vital function brain neurons nervous

mental clarity comes properly timed, properly composed, meaning
right macronutrients right ratios, properly sized meal, well now
justification eating something way improve way brain
works. turns brain going work best got glucose available,
whether like fast not, just reality things.

thing also true neurons body. way able
move limbs body, way able perform exercise movement
kind matter, neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical

something, work,

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose


provides bridge us particular kind sugar, hormone function,

00:32:41 Eat High-Sugar Foods?

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,
understand way work,

dealing brain's preferred source fuel, especially
cautious depriving brain needs. whether not low carb,
high carb, know, keto, vegan, carnivore, substances, like Berberine, very,
potent need take seriously.

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called
master sleep. can find episode easily hubermanlab.com. available
various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts
metabolism occurring people's bodies different phases sleep.
really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep slow wave, sleep, on. go
deeper study future, interesting, think
important. discovered stage sleep associated
particular signature pattern metabolism particular phases sleep
associated sugar metabolism, fat metabolism,
aspects metabolism. reason think study important discuss
context today's discussion sugar brain, many people
experienced effects disrupted sleep appetite. particular,
reported people sleep deprived quality sleep disrupted,
appetite sugary food increases. Now always assumed due
metabolic need triggered sleep deprivation poor sleep.
reading study, important points made authors
relate fact well, sleep known incredibly important effects brain
body, variety systems, immune system, neural functioning, et cetera.
organized sequence particular forms metabolism active particular
phases sleep, very, well orchestrated, know, slow wave sleep,
REM sleep orchestrated 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles
forth, thought perhaps set brain body able regulate
waking hours. therefore, people sleep deprived deprived
certain forms states within sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, creates
disruption particular set metabolic pathways. Now don't leap far
study sugar metabolism neural circuits controlling sugar metabolism. will


say this, look sum total data obesity type two diabetes
metabolic syndromes kind, almost always see disruptions sleep. Now,
sleep apnea caused even just size
somebody's neck weight body. words, don't know direction
effect, metabolic syndromes disrupt sleep, disrupt metabolic
syndromes. indeed authors point quite appropriately, don't
understand direction effects observe either. now
plethora data pointing fact getting quality sleep night helps regulate
not appetite, also specific forms metabolism drive specific appetites.
takeaway is, extravagant potent interesting ways
regulate blood glucose, everything cinnamon lemon juice, Berberine,
sodium caprate, behavioral tools, mere understanding direct
indirect pathways go gut dopamine, et cetera, not establishing
firm foundation proper metabolism, things going sort
rearranging deck chairs Titanic sometimes described. can't
overstate importance getting regular sufficient amount high quality sleep,

basically run sugar, not say eat lot sugar.
see today, states mind body, instance, fasted states, people
report immense amounts mental clarity blood glucose actually
quite low. simply not case sugar ingest, better
brain will function. case people, meaning people
not ketogenic low carbohydrate diet, not adapted low
carbohydrate diets, neurons brain body using glucose order
function. allows neurons fire electrical potentials,
refer it, firing, meaning sending electrical signals length communicate
neurons.

00:14:17 Glucose & Brain Function

illustrate just important glucose brain function, like describe study
just recently came out, sits long history similar studies. one
just came particularly interesting. Now want point that, unless say
otherwise, going refer typical diets, meaning believe people
ingesting starch starch carbohydrate. realize
people following low carbohydrate diets moderately carbohydrate diets.
even know folks so-called carnivore diet,
eat meat organs, maybe little fruit. going assume vast
majority people listening ingest proteins carbohydrates. unless say
ketogenic, emphasize ketosis itself, will, referring kind typical diet
people consuming fats, proteins carbohydrates. count one
individual. point might try carnivore diet, knows, might pure
vegan diet, knows. entire life now, 46 years old,
proud omnivore, meaning tried eat high quality much can, unprocessed
foods, try really avoid highly processed foods. eat three
macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, going assume
well. study like emphasize, recorded neurons, nerve
cells, brain, particular part brain `that responds visual images,
called visual cortex. neurons visual cortex beautifully tuned,
say, particular features see. primary example this, kind
classic example, put little electrode next neuron visual cortex,


put FMRI scanner machine, can detect neural activity,
show bunch just little lines, bars light, dark bars light,
light bars light, screen front you. vertical,
horizontal, 45 degrees, see
neurons respond best, meaning fire lot electrical activity vertical lines,
ones respond horizontal lines, others respond 45 degree lines.
called orientation tuning, meaning orientation line, cardinal
classic feature way visual system built. everything see,
whether face dog cat landscape, built simple
neuron responses. words, look face, neurons deep
brain respond faces. reason neurons can respond
faces receive signals neurons visual cortex.
respond vertical lines, respond horizontal lines,
respond 45 degree lines. built call
hierarchical representation, just fancy language building blocks
see face recognize face. really amazing
phenomenon, happens very, fast. never notice this,
everything built fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now
orientation-tuned neurons fundamental building blocks
make things see, way read, way
recognize faces, mentioned, everything else. Experimentally, quite
straightforward measure sharply tuned one neurons is. words,
show vertical line find neuron brain responds vertical
lines, also ask whether not neuron fires electrical activity response
line not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical 20 degrees 30
degrees. eventually find neuron orientation-tuned
particular range angles. not going respond vertical lines, also going
respond lines 10 degrees off vertical either side, probably not
much more, maybe 20, usually going anywhere vertical just tilted
slightly. recent experiment published journal, "Neuron," Cell Press
journal, excellent journal, authors asked really interesting question, asked
whether not sharpness tuning, precision orientation tuning
neurons dependent blood glucose level. just cut chase, give
answer, found subjects well fed, neurons responded


vertical, responded strongly vertical, not much angles,
call stimuli, lines 10 degrees 20 degrees off. looked
neurons primarily tuned, right, preferred horizontal lines, found
thing. wasn't something unique vertical lines. basically found
sharpness, precision tuning neurons brain, best
subjects fed. conversely, subjects fasted, orientation tuning
neurons became much broader. meant neuron normally
respond vertical now responded angles lines well. might
say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems
appetite works best, given schedule, et cetera. morning, tend
focused. always associated fact fasted. ingest
water caffeine 90 minutes waking up, drink caffeine,
hydrate time get up, et cetera, et cetera. know lot people
experience fasted feeling like lot mental clarity.
fasted state, typically going use fuels available
neurons, based intake food day before, maybe using
glycogen, maybe using fat, maybe using blood sugar,
derived storage sites body. don't actually use fat fuel source
neurons typical conditions. ways proteins fats
glycogen, et cetera, converted fuel neurons can use. interesting
study study says well fed, meaning blood glucose,
sugar, properly elevated level bloodstream, can delivered brain
way allows neurons work best, really just underscore point
made earlier, nervous system extremely metabolically


demanding, loves glucose, neurons love glucose. takeaway study
not avoid fasting, takeaway study
elements fasted state particular elevations things like epinephrine
norepinephrine, also called adrenaline noradrenaline, can give us kind
clarity mind many people pursuing fast. kind one
reasons lot people fast, like way feel, mentally physically.
think fair point glucose preferred source fuel brain.
study mentioned one many studies explored nutritional
status blood glucose status brain body influence neuronal tuning
neuronal function. really points fact ultimately, brain organ,
glucose consuming machine. Now, eat food, food broken
contains carbohydrates, going converted glucose. glucose
can't get directly brain fuel source. actually carried across
so-called blood brain barrier, BBB, actual metabolism glucose
delivery glucose neurons carried different cell type. cell
type know abundant cell type
brain, maybe even entire nervous system, so-called astrocyte.
Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal
function brain plasticity, brain's ability change response experience.
astrocytes like little waiters waitresses bringing glucose neurons
neurons going heavy lifting involved perception
behavior action. prior episode, didn't already realize glucose,
blood sugar, vital function brain neurons nervous
system, now know. experienced increase
mental clarity comes properly timed, properly composed, meaning
right macronutrients right ratios, properly sized meal, well now
justification eating something way improve way brain
works. turns brain going work best got glucose available,
whether like fast not, just reality things.

00:24:19 Glucose & Physical Activity



thing also true neurons body. way able
move limbs body, way able perform exercise movement
kind matter, neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical
potentials muscle fibers, release neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,
causes contraction muscle fibers, allows move limbs.
neurons also metabolically demanding, especially
demanding types physical work, cycling running weightlifting
yoga whatever may be. neurons require ton glucose. ever

walking around running continuously. suddenly focus
doing, generate specific patterns motor movement,
well, feels demanding one, increases release adrenaline
brain body, makes feel little bit agitated alert, also
deliberate thought, deliberately controlling way brain body moving,
requires glucose uptake, energy neurons. also

intense conversation somebody really forcing
listen, hopefully listening too, really trying parse
saying, maybe right now, trying really track
something, work,

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose


provides bridge us particular kind sugar, hormone function,

00:32:41 Eat High-Sugar Foods?

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,
understand way work,

many, many papers. subjects given choice drinking plain water sweet
tasting fluid, preference sweet tasting fluid much, much higher, right?
Sweet tastes better plain water, least people certainly animals.
Now, if, instance, take animal completely lacks sweet receptors,
can molecular genetic tools gymnastics laboratory,
call knockout mice, can knock particular receptor sweet
taste, can confirm no perception sweet things least no
preference sweet things animals. humans, can numb mouth,
pharmacologic ways can eliminate sweet receptors mouth.
that, people will tell you, no, can't taste anything sweet. give

tells us perception sweet important preference sweet tasting
drink. also true sweet tasting foods, mention. However, animal
models humans, 15 minutes, subjects start preferring sugary

ability sense sweet, perceive sweetness foods, eliminate
preference sweet beverages sweet foods. not surprising. wait
15 minutes, preference sweet beverage sweet food comes back.
Now doesn't mean can perceive sweetness. fact, way
experiments done clever. offer people various cups different things

name, called neuropod cells. Neuropod cells famously discovered
Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez Duke University. cells respond to,
among things, presence sugar within gut. ingest sugary
food drink, ingest food drink simply contains fructose, sucrose,
glucose, form sugar later, metabolism, will converted
glucose, neuropod cells able register presence sweet
glucose stimulating foods. response that, send electrical signals,
electrical signals way neurons communicate, brain, via so-called
vagus nerve. vagus nerve, course, nerve pathway, famous role
relaxation. kind assumption there, always involved relaxation,
not case. involved lot things besides relaxation. nonetheless,
neuropod cells send electrical signals particular highway within

talk extensively today. important understanding sugar preference.
neuropod cells also trigger activation dopamine pathways within
mesolimbic reward pathway. words, signals conveyed gut,
meaning stomach intestines, brain anytime ingest sweet foods,

fact sweetness food almost always correlated ability increase blood

crackers, instance, chips instance, might think, oh, well, know, chips,
not sweet, salty savory. again, mention, love salty
savory foods, including certain foods, love kettle chips, instance, try not walk
grocery store. usually eat one bag store,
another later. savory foods often laden hidden sugars can't
register sweetness, trigger neuropod cells, trigger
dopamine, make us want them. Now may able resist eating
them, makes us crave food general. Now will talk ways

say, well, great, right, neurons one point one thing
now tuned things. not great means
fasted state, perception outside world actually distorted, blurred, not
precise fed. say fed, really mean
glucose available neurons. Now, you, maybe many you,
including myself, intermittent fasting, variant thereof, actually state
like. allows focus. instance, mentioned before, even earlier
podcast, tend eat first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. generally eat
last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus minus hour either side, not
super strict it. occasionally wake really hungry eat something
11:00 AM. not super strict intermittent fasting thing. just seems

Astrocytes one several types glia, word glia means glue. many people
taken name, glia, glue, think that, oh, thing astrocytes
just kind holding things together. Actually, astrocytes involved
delivering glucose neurons, critically involved shaping neuronal

00:26:16 Fructose vs. Glucose

work requires glucose uptake neurons, brain body.
Now established glucose preferred source fuel nervous
system, like concentrate types sugars ingest


common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural
pathways within brain, hypothalamus, hungrier regardless many
calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not
metabolized differently brain body, addition that,
fructose impact reducing hormones reduce hunger hormones
neural circuits. fructose kind twist phenotype, right?
guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even
fruit, people will find fruit really quenches appetite. people will find
fruit stimulates appetite. suppose trying stimulate
appetite, ingesting fruit might actually advantageous you. fructose

case Ghrelin hypothalamus. leads us next question,
sugar makes attractive thing us? like
much? obvious answer people arrive is, well, just tastes really,
really good. actually not way works. rewarding property say
sugar, whether not come form sucrose fructose foods
increase glucose high level, actually not just related taste foods
produce elevation glucose, sucrose, fructose. part,
part story, rest story, understand it, can actually place
position much better control sugar intake kinds, also food
intake ways can allow make much better choices foods
ingest. actually point, probably give confession, said today,
say again, said pretty podcast. don't much sweet tooth
indeed true. can kind pass chocolate ice cream things like
that, seems like successive year, sweet things less less appealing
me. course, savory foods, anything really fatty, salty, savory, don't last
long presence, always say, don't really like sweet things much, like
sweet people, don't tend like sweet foods, true. probably one
exception mangoes. turns mangoes highest
percentage sugar them, particular fructose, well forms sugars.
do, love mango much, will mangoes probably twice week,
sort resistance training hard run something like that.
case exercise hard, particular exercise
high intensity variety, body efficient using circulating sugar. able
store use fuel. typically just take mango,
actually eat peels too. know probably people going cringe
hear that, find delicious. just bite things like apples, don't
eat pits, however. now want take us journey

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,

tasting fluid, preference sweet tasting fluid much, much higher, right?
Sweet tastes better plain water, least people certainly animals.
Now, if, instance, take animal completely lacks sweet receptors,
can molecular genetic tools gymnastics laboratory,
call knockout mice, can knock particular receptor sweet
taste, can confirm no perception sweet things least no
preference sweet things animals. humans, can numb mouth,
pharmacologic ways can eliminate sweet receptors mouth.
that, people will tell you, no, can't taste anything sweet. give

Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez Duke University. cells respond to,
among things, presence sugar within gut. ingest sugary
food drink, ingest food drink simply contains fructose, sucrose,
glucose, form sugar later, metabolism, will converted
glucose, neuropod cells able register presence sweet
glucose stimulating foods. response that, send electrical signals,
electrical signals way neurons communicate, brain, via so-called
vagus nerve. vagus nerve, course, nerve pathway, famous role
relaxation. kind assumption there, always involved relaxation,
not case. involved lot things besides relaxation. nonetheless,
neuropod cells send electrical signals particular highway within
vagus so-called nodose ganglion, cluster, ganglion just cluster

talk extensively today. important understanding sugar preference.
neuropod cells also trigger activation dopamine pathways within
mesolimbic reward pathway. words, signals conveyed gut,
meaning stomach intestines, brain anytime ingest sweet foods,

huge problem led great insight. great insight this, preference

means, experimentally, also terms means real

understand circuits exist understand simple

lot control sugar intake sugar appetite
previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et
cetera. time avoiding high glycemic foods high sugar
foods, point out. Now, telling glycemic index? Well,
zoom take perspective discussion glycemic
index, lens nervous system, remind neurons
prefer glucose energy sweet things, things perceive sweet,
also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat
foods, start realize sharp rise blood glucose
high degree elevation blood glucose, going much potent signal
moderate rise blood glucose slower rise blood glucose.
think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary
foods, well glycemic index sort measurement hard
pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine

common basis, impact brain function body function.
particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,
otherwise, ingesting high concentrations fructose not going good
thing way brain functions. One key distinctions glucose
fructose fructose likely cannot directly access brain. actually


needs converted glucose liver. way conversion occurs
feeds back set hormones neural pathways talked earlier,
lot appetite. just summarize now lot solid data,
fructose specifically fructose, ability reduce certain hormones
peptides body whose main job suppress Ghrelin. recall, Ghrelin
hormone increases longer since eaten, Ghrelin makes us
hungry stimulating particular neurons hypothalamus, actually makes us really
want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories
fundamental principle weight loss, weight maintenance weight gain.
Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural

calories eaten. Now also want absolutely clear, not mean
eating apple eating melon eating couple apricots something going
make hyperphagic, meaning going make just want eat, eat, eat,
simply not case. compare fructose compare glucose, not

guess fructose dating profile, kind red flag profile,
fructose itself, actually pretty good fuel source many ways,
often packaged things like fruits, bring along fiber vitamins minerals,
think many us things eating ingesting
of, can suppress pathways suppress hunger. consequence,
can increase hunger. current recommendations people eat fruits
vegetables. trying control hunger, ingesting lot
fruit probably not going good idea. Certainly, ingesting high
fructose corn syrup not going good idea enormous percentages
fructose high fructose corn syrup, 50%, sometimes even more. even

glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,

go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either

elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical

sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,

can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.

study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted

particularly like focus fructose. Fructose, course, found fruit, also found
infamous high fructose corn syrup, will talk today. worth
pointing concentrations fructose fruit quite low compared
concentrations fructose high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup
approximately 50% fructose, turns enormously high percentage
anything, really, especially cut contrast concentrations fructose
fruit. Fruits types sugars well. know, sucrose content
fruit fruit juices low. Although fruits like melons, peaches,
pineapples, forth, contain little less 10% sucrose. Things like
mangoES can lot sucrose. typically amount fructose, fructose, think
proper pronunciation, people always correcting me. Fructose anywhere
1% 10%, right? really going vary quite bit. many
probably heard so-called glycemic index, basically measure fast
blood sugar rises eating particular foods, et cetera. going set aside
glycemic index now, will come back it. relationship
concentrations fructose fruit. point like make fructose
sugar, handled differently body glucose. also want
emphasize percentage fructose fruit rather low, especially
compared high fructose corn syrup, many people demonized fructose saying
fructose makes fat, fruit makes fat. look data, not
really case. fact matter concentrations fructose fruit
low unless someone consuming lot fruit, consuming lot fruit
backdrop highly processed diet diet lot stuff
might not want ingesting, can't really say fructose fattening. don't really
think basis saying fructose bad. Now high fructose corn
syrup different issue, much consumption anything, fructose included,
whether not comes fruit otherwise, can problem ways impacts
neural circuits process sugar, not just glucose, fructose.
illustrate neural circuits bit, it'll become clear you, regardless
whether not background biology metabolism, nutrition,

want eat. particular, really makes us want eat sugary fatty foods.
Fructose reduces activity hormones reduce Ghrelin . net
consequence fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although think pretty
much everyone there, say individuals, agrees calories calories

Ingesting fructose shifts hormone system, consequence, neural

00:35:01 Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings



nervous system explain, pathways brain body regulate
appetite sugar. Now, keep mind already told before,
ingest foods, broken various components glucose going
shuttled brain, course, neurons spinal cord
elsewhere, muscles, cetera, order cells organs
tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot
taste, just much nutritive components
sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest
fructose, fructose can converted glucose liver. mentioned, course,
fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,
jury's still that, will see. fundamental thing understand
think want piece chocolate think want piece cake
craving something sweet, craving taste neurons
literally craving nutritive components arrive taste. simply
understanding can allow circumvent sugar cravings
might otherwise complete hopeless victim to. Also episode, will talk
ways can sort undermine short circuit circuits, will, order
reduce sugar cravings regular basis, goal. Two parallel pathways, one
parallel pathways conscious perception. animals kinds
mice, rats humans, will prefer sugary taste non-sugary taste. eat
something tastes sweet, register sweet taste way sweet receptors,
literally little ports portals neurons tongue pallet, lot people
don't realize this, lot taste receptors soft pallet around
mouth, sides mouth. actually tasting things, not just
tongue, entire mouth pallet. ingest something
sweet, quickly signals sent neurons mouth brain
areas cause seek least pay attention to, source
abundance sweet things. literally change perception. fact,
beautiful neuroimaging studies show people ingest sugary drink,
perception images foods change much make foods appear
appetizing, not just foods contain sugar. Results studies show
increase instance, perception detail images ice cream,
ingest sweet drink even put like hard candy mouth, will
make seek sugary things more, will make sugary things look appetizing,
also foods, appetizing. think important people recognize
fact, sweet taste mouth tasted something
sweet within mouth, say, perception immediately shifted.
fast neural pathways. get brain structures moment,


fast neural pathways shift entire self toward seeking sugary
stuff food generally. Now, mean never ingest
anything sweet? No, certainly not saying that, everyone decide
appropriate amount sugar intake is, find remarkable people say,
oh, know, need get sugar fix, need chocolate, need
little bit something just kind take care sugar appetite.
taking care sugar appetite, maybe disciplined you, can just
one piece chocolate great, can relish it,

00:41:46 Tool: Sugar & Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy

shift way perceive foods well. way
our, probably listener podcast, now old friend, incredible neuro
modulator, dopamine. Dopamine molecule released several places
brain. so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, whole set places
brain circuits, designed get us motivated craving pursuit things.
course areas brain involved movement
linked areas involved motivation. makes perfect sense.
brain area involved motivation couldn't actually something
motivation? way brain designed increase
dopamine, mesolimbic reward pathway, signals sent area
brain called striatum, going spend little bit time today striatum.
got dorsal part, meaning upper part ventral part, means lower part.
dopamine sent area, places us, excuse me, modes action,
pursue particular things. Sugar sweet tastes, say, specific,
incredibly potent ability activate dopamine release within mesolimbic reward
pathway. shown animal models
humans. especially true, mention, ingestion sweet liquids.
Now becomes important point us little later talk
proliferation sodas sweet drinks, dare even say, non-sugar diet sodas,
going get little bit later. perhaps one third rail
topics nutrition. ingest something sweet, perception sweet
taste increases dopamine mesolimbic reward pathways, conveyed
pathways motor behavior, general, place us modes focused action


toward getting whatever sweet. Again,
disciplined, can probably eat one piece chocolate just fine.
understand way dopamine works, realize dopamine
pathway triggered, tends create not sensation perception satiety,
feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways
fill kind emptiness feel gap, like, oh, love more, not
going allow more. Now again, not saying shouldn't pursue
pleasurable things. mean molecule dopamine exists reason. Frankly,
involvement sex reproduction, reason first place.
last time checked, way us got one way another,
sperm met egg conception. still believe no exceptions that,
aware anyways, process, say, events leading
process typically involve dopamine one way another. exceptions
too, get idea. dopamine pathways not evil, not bad,

Sweet tastes better plain water, least people certainly animals.
Now, if, instance, take animal completely lacks sweet receptors,
can molecular genetic tools gymnastics laboratory,
call knockout mice, can knock particular receptor sweet

Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez Duke University. cells respond to,
among things, presence sugar within gut. ingest sugary

evaluating brain areas active eat certain foods done Dr.
Dana Small's lab Yale University, previous work

using experiment. Exactly, huge problem, turns
huge problem led great insight. great insight this, preference
sweet tasting foods liquids actually blocked 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.
means, experimentally, also terms means real
world, yet third parallel pathway related use blood sugar,
use glucose neurons, reinforces desire eat sweet

certainly don't want cover episode. nonetheless, think
understand circuits exist understand simple
substitutions modifications one can make food intake can work
within pathways even bypass pathways, start realize
lot control sugar intake sugar appetite
previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et
cetera. time avoiding high glycemic foods high sugar
foods, point out. Now, telling glycemic index? Well,
zoom take perspective discussion glycemic
index, lens nervous system, remind neurons
prefer glucose energy sweet things, things perceive sweet,
also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat
foods, start realize sharp rise blood glucose
high degree elevation blood glucose, going much potent signal
moderate rise blood glucose slower rise blood glucose.
think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary
foods, well glycemic index sort measurement hard
pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine
caused smoking crack. course goes without saying, please don't cocaine
form, way. appropriate say rate dopamine increase
time profound effect people will, people will, go want pursue
caused increase dopamine. basically saying


going ingest sweet foods order satisfy sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods
glycemic index lower adjusted glycemic index foods
co-ingestion fiber, maybe fat, might beneficial. justification
putting peanut butter piece chocolate ice cream along
mango craving? sense, yes, however, also issue
sweet delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely
delicious foods, trigger one neural circuit, one accelerator talking
terms analogy three accelerators, delicious something
tastes within mouth, increase dopamine. really wanted
adjust sugar cravings really still want ingest sugary foods,
probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,
decided consume broccoli, instance, along chocolate, another
dessert otherwise cause steep increase blood sugar high
glycemic index. nonetheless, goal blunt sugar cravings,
really need blunt dopamine increase. really talking
trying reduce dopamine signal consequence ingesting sweet foods.
talking different parallel pathways, not just
preventing sweet taste, also preventing post-ingestive effects sweet foods.

paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical

don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine

sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,

quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even

pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.

foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et
cetera. time avoiding high glycemic foods high sugar
foods, point out. Now, telling glycemic index? Well,
zoom take perspective discussion glycemic
index, lens nervous system, remind neurons
prefer glucose energy sweet things, things perceive sweet,
also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat
foods, start realize sharp rise blood glucose
high degree elevation blood glucose, going much potent signal
moderate rise blood glucose slower rise blood glucose.
think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary
foods, well glycemic index sort measurement hard
pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine
caused smoking crack. course goes without saying, please don't cocaine
form, way. appropriate say rate dopamine increase
time profound effect people will, people will, go want pursue
caused increase dopamine. basically saying


going ingest sweet foods order satisfy sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods
glycemic index lower adjusted glycemic index foods
co-ingestion fiber, maybe fat, might beneficial. justification
putting peanut butter piece chocolate ice cream along
mango craving? sense, yes, however, also issue
sweet delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely
delicious foods, trigger one neural circuit, one accelerator talking
terms analogy three accelerators, delicious something
tastes within mouth, increase dopamine. really wanted
adjust sugar cravings really still want ingest sugary foods,
probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,
decided consume broccoli, instance, along chocolate, another
dessert otherwise cause steep increase blood sugar high
glycemic index. nonetheless, goal blunt sugar cravings,
really need blunt dopamine increase. really talking
trying reduce dopamine signal consequence ingesting sweet foods.
talking different parallel pathways, not just
preventing sweet taste, also preventing post-ingestive effects sweet foods.

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people

tissues able function. fact many cells organs tissues
require glucose order function led situation dedicated
neural machinery, pieces brain, almost entirely, not entirely devoted,
seeking sugar foods contain sugars. make sure not
seek out, know foods ingest
them. two main ways neural circuits work. fact,
can see two neural circuits entirely work parallel.
common theme throughout nervous system, parallel pathways. Parallel
pathways ways can distinguish light dark, parallel pathways
ways can distinguish high pitched sounds low pitched sounds, parallel
pathways ways can flex muscles versus extend muscles.
instance, move wrist closer shoulder, flexing bicep
actually inhibiting, actually preventing action tricep. move
wrist away shoulder, essentially using extensor, tricep,
inhibiting activity bicep. every function body
might think controlled one brain area one neural circuit, almost always
two called parallel pathways ensure particular behavior
happens. Now, case sugar consumption, two parallel pathways involve one
pathway related actual taste perception taste lead, not just you,
every animal aware of, seek sweet containing foods.
parallel pathway related nutritive component sweet foods. Meaning
degree given food will raise blood glucose. want repeat that. One pathway
brain body devoted getting seek sweet tasting things
perceive sweet, another parallel pathway devoted getting seek
foods lead increases blood glucose. just happens foods lead
big increases blood glucose typically associated sweet taste. Now,
distinctly different neural pathways control seeking savory foods
salty foods spicy foods, matter, bitter foods. sweet pathway
call hardwired. exists, far know, every mammal, even exists fruit


flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff body might seem like lot

sweet tasting foods carry, fact nervous system many cells
brain body run glucose. recall earlier, said, even ingest

fructose may actually work directly brain, still unclear humans,

feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training

thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine

probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

feeling like something enough, rather produce sensation wanting more.
described episode hosted phenomenal colleague Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, expert addiction dopamine
pathways, dopamine circuits brain call pleasure pain balance.
paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly
precarious state in. not say shouldn't piece chocolate,
just say sweet taste sweet things particular, things crave
much wait wait wait, allow indulge.
trigger changes neurochemistry, neuro circuits, place us
vulnerable place, either want thing seek ways

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly
recommend it. Whether not issues addiction know people
do, don't, incredibly important read, especially interested
understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting
time general, phenomenal book. book, course, within research
articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,
lack. can actually notice phenomenon if, instance, somebody
really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action
pain circuits. puts complicated seesaw. wobbly

go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic

leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic

paraphrasing Dr. Anna Lembke said, written
beautiful book, "Dopamine Nation." haven't read book, highly

understanding motivated behaviors ways channel behaviors life toward
healthy, motivated behaviors, make sure avoid common pitfalls
people fall into, not just addiction, things like overuse social media wasting

articles, will find evidence so-called pleasure pain balance exists within
dopamine circuits. Nobody dopamine circuits allow escape
pleasure pain balance. way works anytime engage
behavior ingest something increases levels dopamine,
subsequent increase neural circuits control sense frustration, pain,

really likes chocolate, really like something else, pay attention way
experience indulging thing. eat piece chocolate really focus
savoring amazing taste, notice provides quenching
desire say sweet stuff chocolate both, right stop experiencing
that, right chocolate intake tapers off, swallow throat,
just pause second afterwards, notice brain body actually
orient toward wanting more. wanting really action neural
circuits underlie pain pushing dopamine levels back down.
circuits go awry say, people fail control within
context pleasure pain balance, typical behavior reach yet another
chocolate look something will quench desire get dopamine
levels back up. Now way pleasure pain circuits work diabolical.


turns take another piece chocolate, yes,
dopamine levels go back up, not extent first bite
chocolate had. fact, can say longer since
indulged something really enjoy like, greater dopamine
will experience finally engage behavior indulge thing, ingest
thing, greater dopamine increase, greater subsequent action

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et

zoom take perspective discussion glycemic

prefer glucose energy sweet things, things perceive sweet,
also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat

think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary
foods, well glycemic index sort measurement hard
pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine
caused smoking crack. course goes without saying, please don't cocaine
form, way. appropriate say rate dopamine increase
time profound effect people will, people will, go want pursue
caused increase dopamine. basically saying


going ingest sweet foods order satisfy sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods
glycemic index lower adjusted glycemic index foods
co-ingestion fiber, maybe fat, might beneficial. justification
putting peanut butter piece chocolate ice cream along
mango craving? sense, yes, however, also issue
sweet delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely
delicious foods, trigger one neural circuit, one accelerator talking
terms analogy three accelerators, delicious something
tastes within mouth, increase dopamine. really wanted
adjust sugar cravings really still want ingest sugary foods,
probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,
decided consume broccoli, instance, along chocolate, another
dessert otherwise cause steep increase blood sugar high

really need blunt dopamine increase. really talking

laboratories showing. called
conditioned taste preference. Using kind Pavlovian paradigm, do,
people, studies done people, ingest maltodextrin,
increases blood glucose, doesn't much flavor, even little bit
subtle flavor, maltodextrin cloaked flavor. cloaking
flavor pairing flavor, find time,
maltodextrin increases blood glucose, ingesting particular
flavor along maltodextrin, can remove maltodextrin, flavor
will induce increase insulin. increase insulin course, consequence
fact anytime rise blood glucose, provided person isn't diabetic,

well first pass, says Pavlovian terms physiological
responses foods particular flavors come associated particular patterns
blood glucose increase hence patterns insulin increase, course,


insulin manages glucose bloodstream mentioned earlier. also
implications understanding things like artificial sweeteners. want
highlight still controversial work, needs data, nonetheless,
like share consideration. small laboratory done studies

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate

increasing substance, flavor alone will increase insulin insulin typically
follows blood glucose. conditioning effect. Now, reason data
controversial several fold. First all, landscape around discussion around

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause
insulin increase. flavor associated certain artificial sweeteners included
category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply

artificial sweeteners increase insulin, even absence food.
words, just draw scenario real world. diet soda along

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et
cetera. time avoiding high glycemic foods high sugar

zoom take perspective discussion glycemic

also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat

think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary

pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine
caused smoking crack. course goes without saying, please don't cocaine
form, way. appropriate say rate dopamine increase
time profound effect people will, people will, go want pursue
caused increase dopamine. basically saying


going ingest sweet foods order satisfy sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods
glycemic index lower adjusted glycemic index foods
co-ingestion fiber, maybe fat, might beneficial. justification
putting peanut butter piece chocolate ice cream along
mango craving? sense, yes, however, also issue
sweet delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely
delicious foods, trigger one neural circuit, one accelerator talking
terms analogy three accelerators, delicious something
tastes within mouth, increase dopamine. really wanted
adjust sugar cravings really still want ingest sugary foods,
probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,
decided consume broccoli, instance, along chocolate, another
dessert otherwise cause steep increase blood sugar high
glycemic index. nonetheless, goal blunt sugar cravings,
really need blunt dopamine increase. really talking
trying reduce dopamine signal consequence ingesting sweet foods.
talking different parallel pathways, not just
preventing sweet taste, also preventing post-ingestive effects sweet foods.

laboratories showing. called
conditioned taste preference. Using kind Pavlovian paradigm, do,
people, studies done people, ingest maltodextrin,
increases blood glucose, doesn't much flavor, even little bit
subtle flavor, maltodextrin cloaked flavor. cloaking
flavor pairing flavor, find time,
maltodextrin increases blood glucose, ingesting particular
flavor along maltodextrin, can remove maltodextrin, flavor
will induce increase insulin. increase insulin course, consequence
fact anytime rise blood glucose, provided person isn't diabetic,
parallel increase insulin. Now interesting says is,
well first pass, says Pavlovian terms physiological
responses foods particular flavors come associated particular patterns
blood glucose increase hence patterns insulin increase, course,


insulin manages glucose bloodstream mentioned earlier. also
implications understanding things like artificial sweeteners. want
highlight still controversial work, needs data, nonetheless,
like share consideration. small laboratory done studies

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate
flavor increase blood glucose. can remove glucose
increasing substance, flavor alone will increase insulin insulin typically
follows blood glucose. conditioning effect. Now, reason data
controversial several fold. First all, landscape around discussion around
artificial sweeteners definitely call barbed wire topic. want
preface say next saying, actually ingest artificial sweeteners. will

month. don't particularly like taste, just 'cause around, want
caffeine like carbonation plane something, ingest plant-
based non-caloric sweeteners. knowledge, not high quality
studies plant-based non-caloric sweeteners context referring here.
Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause
insulin increase. flavor associated certain artificial sweeteners included
category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply
increase blood glucose, potential, highlight potential,
artificial sweeteners increase insulin, even absence food.
words, just draw scenario real world. diet soda along
cheeseburger fries. every day lunch, okay? Somewhat
extreme example, natural world example, every day lunch.
just diet soda alone. extreme interpretation data
collected says, well, diet soda alone will increase insulin, even though no


increase blood glucose haven't ingested food
conditioned taste artificial sweetener experience rise glucose
hence insulin. Now counter argument be, well, unusual
situation, maltodextrin causes big increases blood glucose, not really fair
experiment not natural world experiment. think decent assessment.
Although will point one reasons study controversial

particularly experiment children stopped changes insulin
observed early study detrimental, institutional review
board, quite appropriately, said, can't kids. experiencing
odd shifts insulin not healthy just ingesting

work Dana Small done humans. parallel work others

no need conditioned response become Pavlovian this, right?
hardwired want eat sweet things, least two probably three parallel
pathways. Now work Dana Small's lab others illustrated
conditioned flavor preference, think beautifully show flavor associated

words, circuits dopamine reinforce desire eat particular things
not unique sugar pathway. one reasons believe, ingestion

textbooks now, addition, ingesting sweet foods and/or foods raise blood

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either
absolute level blood glucose particular food causes rate
elevation blood glucose occurs. seemingly paradoxical
aspects sweet stuff terms glycemic index. instance, Ice cream
lower glycemic index, provided ice cream includes fat, hope would,
'cause good tasting ice cream, opinion, compared something like
mangoes table sugar, right? glycemic index not something hold holy,
cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training
deplete glycogen, hard resistance training, actually make point ingest
sweet high glycemic foods like mango, also ingest starches 'cause
trying replenish glycogen. also trying spike blood sugar little bit
can advantageous terms certain strength hypertrophy protocols, et
cetera. time avoiding high glycemic foods high sugar
foods, point out. Now, telling glycemic index? Well,
zoom take perspective discussion glycemic
index, lens nervous system, remind neurons
prefer glucose energy sweet things, things perceive sweet,
also sweet things ingested registered neuropod cells gut
trigger release dopamine trigger neural circuits make us want eat
foods, start realize sharp rise blood glucose
high degree elevation blood glucose, going much potent signal
moderate rise blood glucose slower rise blood glucose.
think analogy three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits,


essentially get us seek consume sweet tasting sugary
foods, well glycemic index sort measurement hard
pushing fast pushing three accelerators.
trying reduce sugar take, want
understanding neural circuits work, want short circuit
dopamine release caused ingesting sugary foods. can advantageous
ingest sweet foods, either alone combination foods reduce glycemic
index reduce glycemic load. might mean making different food choices.
paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not
steep say, not cause steep rise blood sugar, mean
consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine
pathways, can come somewhat sinister, nonetheless appropriate
analogy. drug, cocaine, causes robust, potent increases dopamine within
brain, typically causes people want ingest cocaine
sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,
smokable form cocaine rock, increases dopamine high degree, also
quickly. sharp rise dopamine time, not much absolute level
dopamine, makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive. sometimes hear,
know, sugar like crack, well, getting little extreme even
though don't think measurements done experiment, think
reasonable think absolute level dopamine caused ingesting sugar,
least people, not going high absolute level dopamine
caused smoking crack. course goes without saying, please don't cocaine
form, way. appropriate say rate dopamine increase
time profound effect people will, people will, go want pursue
caused increase dopamine. basically saying


going ingest sweet foods order satisfy sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods
glycemic index lower adjusted glycemic index foods
co-ingestion fiber, maybe fat, might beneficial. justification
putting peanut butter piece chocolate ice cream along
mango craving? sense, yes, however, also issue
sweet delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely
delicious foods, trigger one neural circuit, one accelerator talking
terms analogy three accelerators, delicious something
tastes within mouth, increase dopamine. really wanted
adjust sugar cravings really still want ingest sugary foods,
probably better off combining fiber sugary sweet food. Now
realize somewhat unusual probably get strange stares,
decided consume broccoli, instance, along chocolate, another
dessert otherwise cause steep increase blood sugar high
glycemic index. nonetheless, goal blunt sugar cravings,
really need blunt dopamine increase. really talking
trying reduce dopamine signal consequence ingesting sweet foods.
talking different parallel pathways, not just
preventing sweet taste, also preventing post-ingestive effects sweet foods.

01:14:33 Artificial Sweeteners

laboratories showing. called
conditioned taste preference. Using kind Pavlovian paradigm, do,
people, studies done people, ingest maltodextrin,
increases blood glucose, doesn't much flavor, even little bit
subtle flavor, maltodextrin cloaked flavor. cloaking
flavor pairing flavor, find time,
maltodextrin increases blood glucose, ingesting particular
flavor along maltodextrin, can remove maltodextrin, flavor
will induce increase insulin. increase insulin course, consequence
fact anytime rise blood glucose, provided person isn't diabetic,
parallel increase insulin. Now interesting says is,
well first pass, says Pavlovian terms physiological
responses foods particular flavors come associated particular patterns
blood glucose increase hence patterns insulin increase, course,


insulin manages glucose bloodstream mentioned earlier. also
implications understanding things like artificial sweeteners. want
highlight still controversial work, needs data, nonetheless,
like share consideration. small laboratory done studies
humans, adults children, showing flavor artificial sweeteners
paired maltodextrin, maltodextrin removed, artificial
sweetener taste can subsequently increase insulin bloodstream.
words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate
flavor increase blood glucose. can remove glucose
increasing substance, flavor alone will increase insulin insulin typically
follows blood glucose. conditioning effect. Now, reason data
controversial several fold. First all, landscape around discussion around
artificial sweeteners definitely call barbed wire topic. want
preface say next saying, actually ingest artificial sweeteners. will
occasional diet soda, not every day, maybe don't know, twice
month. don't particularly like taste, just 'cause around, want
caffeine like carbonation plane something, ingest plant-
based non-caloric sweeteners. knowledge, not high quality
studies plant-based non-caloric sweeteners context referring here.
Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause
insulin increase. flavor associated certain artificial sweeteners included
category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply
increase blood glucose, potential, highlight potential,
artificial sweeteners increase insulin, even absence food.
words, just draw scenario real world. diet soda along
cheeseburger fries. every day lunch, okay? Somewhat
extreme example, natural world example, every day lunch.
just diet soda alone. extreme interpretation data
collected says, well, diet soda alone will increase insulin, even though no


increase blood glucose haven't ingested food
conditioned taste artificial sweetener experience rise glucose
hence insulin. Now counter argument be, well, unusual
situation, maltodextrin causes big increases blood glucose, not really fair
experiment not natural world experiment. think decent assessment.
Although will point one reasons study controversial
data controversial, experiment actually stopped.
particularly experiment children stopped changes insulin
observed early study detrimental, institutional review
board, quite appropriately, said, can't kids. experiencing
odd shifts insulin not healthy just ingesting
artificial sweeteners absence glucose increasing foods. again,
ingest artificial sweeteners, not saying dangerous, not saying
not dangerous, saying decide yourself. previous
episodes, highlighted artificial sweeteners shown studies
animals, given high doses, sucralose particular, can fairly
robust disruption gut microbiome, vital immune health brain
health, et cetera, et cetera. thus far, knowledge artificial sweeteners
negatively impacts positively impacts, say, microbiome
deleterious effects body, mainly explored animal studies. Again,
work Dana Small done humans. parallel work others
animal models. bring today illustrate following point. Normally
pathway don't condition all, birth, whereby ingestion
sweet foods causes increases dopamine. parallel pathways
neurons gut elsewhere body, trigger increases dopamine.
no need conditioned response become Pavlovian this, right?
hardwired want eat sweet things, least two probably three parallel
pathways. Now work Dana Small's lab others illustrated
conditioned flavor preference, think beautifully show flavor associated
glucose spike long sustained increase glucose can also conditioned.
words, circuits dopamine reinforce desire eat particular things
not unique sugar pathway. one reasons believe, ingestion
sweet foods doesn't just us want eat sweet foods, think absolutely
clear based animal data human data, think robust, actually stuff


textbooks now, addition, ingesting sweet foods and/or foods raise blood
glucose, don't perceive sweet. instance, foods hidden sugars,
sugars masked asked salty spicy taste, increases desire

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people

yet another episode ADHD point go little bit deeper
that, new data. long fairly extensive episode
ADHD. welcome look like archive, excuse me,

nuance around that. also interesting terms ADHD sugar intake,
probably relevance us, also cover interesting data

previously thought. Now, many heard so-called glycemic index.
glycemic index measure quickly blood sugar rises ingesting particular
foods. broadly speaking, can say low glycemic index foods,
less 55, typically, measurement, medium glycemic index foods,


go 55 69, called high glycemic foods, 70.
course additional nuance related glycemic load many
features glycemic index. couple things understand glycemic
index measured. like just briefly talk glycemic index can
leveraged short circuit neural circuits otherwise lead us
crave perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First all, measurements glycemic
indices food typically made people ingest foods isolation.
general, can say anytime ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along
particular food, will reduce glycemic index particular food, either

cases, people not ingesting foods isolation.
actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training

paying attention sweet tasting foods can satisfy sugar cravings, not

consuming foods along sweet foods order reduce glycemic index
thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine

sharp increases dopamine. within category drug cocaine,
various modes ingestion. people inhale it, people will inject
intravenously, people will smoke it, different forms taking cocaine
actually impact dopamine circuits differently. turns crack cocaine,

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people

actually lot argument whether not glycemic index really vital
people claim. also context ingest particular foods.
mentioned earlier, hard training kind, meaning training

thereby, slow blunt release dopamine. might think, well, want
that? want maximum dopamine output response given sweet food.
don't just want know, level 10. want level 100 output dopamine.
really don't, pleasure pain balance dopamine causes. fact,
consider non-food substances really push hard dopamine

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause

category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply

yet another episode ADHD point go little bit deeper
that, new data. long fairly extensive episode
ADHD. welcome look like archive, excuse me,

implications understanding things like artificial sweeteners. want
highlight still controversial work, needs data, nonetheless,
like share consideration. small laboratory done studies

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate
flavor increase blood glucose. can remove glucose
increasing substance, flavor alone will increase insulin insulin typically
follows blood glucose. conditioning effect. Now, reason data
controversial several fold. First all, landscape around discussion around
artificial sweeteners definitely call barbed wire topic. want
preface say next saying, actually ingest artificial sweeteners. will
occasional diet soda, not every day, maybe don't know, twice
month. don't particularly like taste, just 'cause around, want
caffeine like carbonation plane something, ingest plant-
based non-caloric sweeteners. knowledge, not high quality
studies plant-based non-caloric sweeteners context referring here.
Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause
insulin increase. flavor associated certain artificial sweeteners included
category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply
increase blood glucose, potential, highlight potential,
artificial sweeteners increase insulin, even absence food.
words, just draw scenario real world. diet soda along
cheeseburger fries. every day lunch, okay? Somewhat
extreme example, natural world example, every day lunch.
just diet soda alone. extreme interpretation data
collected says, well, diet soda alone will increase insulin, even though no


increase blood glucose haven't ingested food
conditioned taste artificial sweetener experience rise glucose
hence insulin. Now counter argument be, well, unusual
situation, maltodextrin causes big increases blood glucose, not really fair
experiment not natural world experiment. think decent assessment.
Although will point one reasons study controversial
data controversial, experiment actually stopped.
particularly experiment children stopped changes insulin
observed early study detrimental, institutional review

odd shifts insulin not healthy just ingesting

work Dana Small done humans. parallel work others

no need conditioned response become Pavlovian this, right?
hardwired want eat sweet things, least two probably three parallel
pathways. Now work Dana Small's lab others illustrated
conditioned flavor preference, think beautifully show flavor associated

say, esoteric ones, many however can quite potent. first
simple lemon juice, right, lime juice. old lore actually

like share consideration. small laboratory done studies

words, taking something increases blood sugar, attaching flavor experience
that, children adults ingest thing, allows nervous system associate

controversial several fold. First all, landscape around discussion around

Nonetheless, studies show particular flavors can conditioned cause
insulin increase. flavor associated certain artificial sweeteners included
category flavors can induce insulin, even absence something
can increase blood glucose. Now simple takeaway studies
following, actually one interpretation Dana Small offered data,
offers interpretations well. One interpretation people
going ingest artificial sweeteners, along foods sharply
increase blood glucose, potential, highlight potential,
artificial sweeteners increase insulin, even absence food.
words, just draw scenario real world. diet soda along

extreme example, natural world example, every day lunch.
just diet soda alone. extreme interpretation data
collected says, well, diet soda alone will increase insulin, even though no


increase blood glucose haven't ingested food
conditioned taste artificial sweetener experience rise glucose
hence insulin. Now counter argument be, well, unusual
situation, maltodextrin causes big increases blood glucose, not really fair
experiment not natural world experiment. think decent assessment.
Although will point one reasons study controversial

particularly experiment children stopped changes insulin
observed early study detrimental, institutional review

yet another episode ADHD point go little bit deeper
that, new data. long fairly extensive episode
ADHD. welcome look like archive, excuse me,

01:35:15 Tool: Blunt Sugar Peaks & Craving Lemon Juice

Now ways reduce sugar craving certainly ways
reduce sharp rise blood glucose can occur ingest sugary sweet
foods even just abundance carbohydrate foods, huge number
things. going sort layer ones might find
cupboard, grocery store, get extravagant


say, esoteric ones, many however can quite potent. first
simple lemon juice, right, lime juice. old lore actually
papers, pointing idea ingestion vinegar, either white vinegar wine
vinegar, somehow blunt blood glucose ingestion sugary foods
ingestion lot carbohydrate foods, even just big meal. Actually, Tim Ferris,
say great Tim Ferris, 'cause great respect fact seems
10 years ahead everything, terms nutrition skill learning
things sort, many things predicted books, "The Four Hour
Body" "The Four Hour Chef" actually turned true based scientific data,
exists animal models, now also predictions
played true animal models human models. think
Tim certainly deserves hat tip fact experimented
methods reported experiences methods now them,
many them, validated perceive quality science. talked
fact that, least experiments himself, ingestion vinegar not
seem blunt blood glucose, using continuous glucose monitors.
incidentally, another example Ferris early game rest us
kind just wake. talked use blood glucose monitors, those,
think time implanted skin. Nowadays less invasive blood
glucose monitors, things like Levels forth, actually becoming pretty
popular. worn one before. actually pretty informative. learned
instance, go sauna experience sharp rise blood glucose.
makes sense dehydration associated sauna,
lot sweating, concentration sugar bloodstream goes up.
things certain foods affect blood glucose one way another. kind
interesting fun experiment might interested well.
Regardless, now data pointing fact lemon juice lime juice,
couple tablespoons so, ingested before, even during, even after, consumption
sugary foods, say foods sharply increase blood glucose large
carbohydrate meals, can actually blunt blood glucose response. see
experiments continuous glucose monitor, kind
fun experiments. preferred experiments eating somewhat
larger meals things didn't contain lot sugar. saw big increases blood
glucose certain instances, ingest lemon juice lime juice,


typically mixed water. sure enough, see blunting blood
glucose response. course real time, continuous, hence continuous,
blood glucose monitoring. interested blunting blood
sugar response, certain foods, simple, low cost way that, want
explore it. will say, fasting already low blood glucose,
ingest lemon juice, say lemon juice water lime juice water,
careful can actually become hypoglycemic. reasons
lemon juice lime juice can blunt blood glucose blood glucose
levels moderate high, can also reduce blood glucose levels even
blood glucose levels low. Now lemon juice lime juice there. can't
say acidic things, generally. just side point, many
probably seen store, called adjusted pH waters foods drinks
supposed adjust pH. Hate break you, pH tightly
regulated throughout brain body. not want change. entirely
impossible, least safe way, become quote unquote
alkaline ingesting alkaline water something like that. true pH,
alkalinity acidity varies different compartments body, important.
Unless hemorrhaging vomiting, something badly wrong you,
health wise, really dire circumstance, don't want big shifts
body pH body sorts ways buffering changes pH.
encourage not fall the, hop bandwagon adjusting pH
becoming less acidic, kind thing. ingest lemon juice lime juice,
mechanism blunts blood glucose probably twofold. One probably
post-ingestive effects glucose gut, meaning way sugars
interacting neurons components gut circuitry impact things
like gastric emptying time, impact things like firing neuropod cells
signaling brain. almost certainly something also
perception sour taste tongue. didn't go much today, you,
course, don't just sweet taste receptors mouth, also bitter taste
receptors, salty taste receptors, sour taste receptors mouth
course, means tongue palate. interacting.
ingest substance just sweet mostly sweet, causes certain set effects
blood glucose, also brain, dopamine, neuro circuits
brain. also ingest something sour like lemon juice lime juice,


adjusts output neural circuits brain. again,
situation two parallel pathways, one post-ingestive coming
phenomenon within gut neurons, also things like gastric emptying time,
clearance transfer food, conversion food particular nutrients
circulation glucose bloodstream gets brain. also
simply ingesting something sour, changing way sweet things impact
brain. think stands reason lemon juice/lime juice effect not
going magic. going everything way ingesting sour
foods can adjust taste. Excuse me, can adjust neural response taste sweet
foods. fact, know based beautiful work Charles Zuker Columbia
Medical School, exactly happens. measured activity
neurons various locations so-called taste pathways brain. found
particular tastes like just sweet just bitter just sour evoke certain
ensembles neurons fire particular sequences, sweet sour co-
ingested, bitter sour co-ingested, get distinct ensembles, meaning
distinct patterns activity neurons. course, distinct patterns
downstream activity within brain body. still somewhat mysterious
exactly things like lemon juice lime juice can reduce blood glucose
spikes. ingest sweet foods carbohydrate laden foods, big
meals, can use tool understanding grounding
biology way circuits work.

01:43:09 Tool: Reduce Sugar Cravings & Spikes Cinnamon

Now, probably heard cinnamon can useful tool controlling
blood sugar. indeed case. clear cinnamon can adjust rate
glucose entry stream, possibly changing rate gastric emptying,
might slow rate gastric emptying thereby also reduce glycemic index
particular foods. suppose going eat mango, hadn't just done
bunch hard training, might sprinkle cinnamon here. always enjoy kind
coming new ideas ways can eat foods podcasts.
event, debate there, look online whether not Saigon
Cinnamon, Cassia cinnamon, excuse me, Ceylon cinnamon best purposes
blunting blood glucose spikes. think the, least read data


found, doesn't really matter provided real cinnamon.
actually look make sure real cinnamon, lot cinnamon
buy not real. want provide cautionary note cinnamon however.
Cinnamon contains something called coumarin. can toxic high levels.
don't want ingest teaspoon, maybe teaspoon half
cinnamon per day, start exceed threshold cinnamon
start problematic. certainly going big meal meal
lot sugar it, lot carbohydrate laden foods, don't want increase
blood glucose, put cinnamon beverage, put cinnamon
food order blunt blood glucose increase, reduce glycemic index way
reducing gastric emptying time. Again, just making sure don't get past
one half teaspoons per day, 'cause really don't want start dealing
toxicity related coumarin. talked lemon juice lime juice
cinnamon, kind commonplace many kitchens. course can
venture esoteric say advanced tools

01:45:10 Berberine, Sustained Low Blood Glucose Levels

adjusting sugar intake. one comes mind course Berberine.
Berberine derivative tree bark very, potent substance reducing
blood glucose. much par Metformin Glibenclamide,
prescription drugs specifically used reduce blood glucose. using Berberine
serious step, absolutely talk doctor it. know number
people use lower blood glucose eat really large meals. know
number people using get effects Metformin
people discussed, things like activating tapping so-called AMPK
pathway, reducing mTOR, people aiming activities increasing
longevity, somewhat controversial approach, still, know many people it.
true ingest Berberine, blood glucose will plummet. point
actually tried before, gave brutal headaches felt really
dizzy, felt like couldn't see straight. actually couldn't see straight,
that? Well, made hypoglycemic. actually drove blood glucose
far. reason took Berberine empty stomach. know
people can tolerate it. say, cautious ingesting Berberine


empty stomach, low carbohydrate diet, unless really know
medical professional kind guide that.
took Berberine along large meal, included lot carbohydrates,
know, can recall days Costello eat couple pizzas
might get ice cream, kind thing. felt perfectly fine even 750
milligrams gram Berberine. kind unique property making feel
not overwhelmed amount blood glucose increase experiencing
eating big meal. don't quite know else describe it. almost can
keep eating eating eating, course protect gastric

using gorge food, just heard it, interested experimenting it.
don't chronic blood sugar issues. again, took empty
stomach, made hypoglycemic low carbohydrate intake, hypoglycemic, not
good experience. again, experience think avoid. provided lot
glucose bloodstream, certainly experimental type
trying regulate blood glucose, Berberine might good option. again, talk
doctor. interesting effects terms lowering total
cholesterol research supported reducing insulin little bit. Well, not
surprising reduce blood glucose, going reduce insulin course,
insulin manages blood glucose bloodstream. place Berberine
course, Metformin Glibenclamide kind heavy hitting potent tools
regulating blood glucose. Now, episode, not sugar per se, sugar
viewed lens nervous system. interesting Berberine,
Metformin, Glibenclamide related substances, effects
course gastric emptying buffering blood glucose within bloodstream, et cetera.
appeared also neural effects chronically low glucose
blunting blood glucose things like Berberine. neural effects
include longstanding changes hormonal cascades consequence
low blood sugar thereby, changes neural circuits manage blood

longstanding changes neural circuitry regulates blood sugar time.
might welcome changes, right? Reduce sugar cravings instance.
really, really serious modulating blood glucose things like
Berberine, typical dose range, again, anywhere half gram 1.5 grams
daily, typical dosages explored.
substances like sodium caprate known augment effects Berberine via
AMPK pathways. basically can increase ability Berberine
glucose lowering actions. course getting really potent,
call sharp blade tools controlling blood glucose. listen, anytime dealing
blood glucose, dealing brain's preferred source fuel. anytime
dealing brain's preferred source fuel, especially
cautious depriving brain needs. whether not low carb,
high carb, know, keto, vegan, carnivore, substances, like Berberine, very,
potent need take seriously.

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called
master sleep. can find episode easily hubermanlab.com. available
various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts

really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go

01:45:10 Berberine, Sustained Low Blood Glucose Levels

adjusting sugar intake. one comes mind course Berberine.
Berberine derivative tree bark very, potent substance reducing

prescription drugs specifically used reduce blood glucose. using Berberine
serious step, absolutely talk doctor it. know number
people use lower blood glucose eat really large meals. know
number people using get effects Metformin
people discussed, things like activating tapping so-called AMPK
pathway, reducing mTOR, people aiming activities increasing
longevity, somewhat controversial approach, still, know many people it.
true ingest Berberine, blood glucose will plummet. point
actually tried before, gave brutal headaches felt really
dizzy, felt like couldn't see straight. actually couldn't see straight,
that? Well, made hypoglycemic. actually drove blood glucose
far. reason took Berberine empty stomach. know
people can tolerate it. say, cautious ingesting Berberine


empty stomach, low carbohydrate diet, unless really know
medical professional kind guide that.
took Berberine along large meal, included lot carbohydrates,
know, can recall days Costello eat couple pizzas

cautious depriving brain needs. whether not low carb,
high carb, know, keto, vegan, carnivore, substances, like Berberine, very,
potent need take seriously.

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called
master sleep. can find episode easily hubermanlab.com. available
various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts
metabolism occurring people's bodies different phases sleep.
really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep slow wave, sleep, on. go
deeper study future, interesting, think
important. discovered stage sleep associated
particular signature pattern metabolism particular phases sleep
associated sugar metabolism, fat metabolism,
aspects metabolism. reason think study important discuss
context today's discussion sugar brain, many people
experienced effects disrupted sleep appetite. particular,
reported people sleep deprived quality sleep disrupted,

amino acid intake certain forms fatty acid intake. ways
can reduce sugar cravings, ideally ways can that, also benefit us
ways, nutritionally neuroscience standpoint? Well,
neuropod cells respond signal brain ingest sugar,
mentioned, also respond amino acids essential fatty acids. already talked
essential fatty acids. make particular point ingest anywhere one
three grams, grams, EPA essential fatty acid per day. make point
ingestion high quality omega-3s. me, simplest way that,
think people, lowest cost way that, use liquid form fish oil
capsule form fish oil. really see much essential fatty acid
form EPA those. try capsules, can get
kind expensive, depending particular brands use, EPA,
less. can, course also foods, can non fish
sources, things like algae, forms, can look
online now, plant-based sources EPAs, can high quality fish oil.
case, seem least based modest amount, nonetheless solid
literature, reduce sugar cravings somewhat, easily mere
replacement calories. don't know yet based human studies, whether not
ingestion EPAs specifically activating neuropod cells,
specifically activates dopamine release bypasses need for, craving
sugar. don't know yet. logically, holds assume that. fact
neuropod cells say neurons within gut respond robustly
presence particular amino acids also potential lever one
reduce sugar cravings. interesting literature around amino acid,
glutamine, particular supplementing amino acid, glutamine, relates
sugar cravings, certainly relates aspects gut, particular leaky
gut. use supplemental glutamine try treat leaky gut not new
phenomenon. approaches too, course. many people
experimenting supplementing glutamine, several grams per day, often
even, know, five grams distributed three four different servings
throughout day way blunt sugar cravings. Now not yet
large scale clinical trial using glutamine reduce sugar cravings, results
studies looked at, well understanding logic neuro
circuits, including neuropod cells, brings us conclusion makes sense


population neurons within gut, responds robustly
presence sugar, fatty acids, amino acids, intake particular amino acids
allow dopamine pathways might otherwise triggered sugar
triggered something like glutamine, no calories. fact,
talked previously, number people know went tried
this, now course call anec data, right? not quality peer

feel sugar cravings reduced. know people actually take
glutamine mix full fat cream take kind like shot full fat cream,
sounds absolutely delicious way, glutamine little bit chalky, not
great tasting ingest sugar. mention, try take
approach ingesting glutamine reduce sugar cravings, want increase
amount glutamine take somewhat gradually. can create gastric
distress just, know, certainly wouldn't take big table spoon it, throw
water chug three times day. hardy stomachs can
probably tolerate that. know, like bulldog, unfortunately passed
away, Costello, always imagine ever autopsy him,
like license plate like human gut, 'cause seemed like
ingest anything no issues, course, many people kind sensitive guts.
going try taking glutamine means reduce sugar cravings, just know
studies still ongoing. people achieved benefit. Please also
realize entire literature devoted potential hazards increasing
glutamine preexisting cancer. cancer cancer
prone, really discourage approach. case, always,
talk doctor. logic nonetheless there, increasing amino acid intake

01:35:15 Tool: Blunt Sugar Peaks & Craving Lemon Juice

Now ways reduce sugar craving certainly ways
reduce sharp rise blood glucose can occur ingest sugary sweet
foods even just abundance carbohydrate foods, huge number
things. going sort layer ones might find
cupboard, grocery store, get extravagant


say, esoteric ones, many however can quite potent. first
simple lemon juice, right, lime juice. old lore actually
papers, pointing idea ingestion vinegar, either white vinegar wine
vinegar, somehow blunt blood glucose ingestion sugary foods
ingestion lot carbohydrate foods, even just big meal. Actually, Tim Ferris,
say great Tim Ferris, 'cause great respect fact seems
10 years ahead everything, terms nutrition skill learning
things sort, many things predicted books, "The Four Hour

many them, validated perceive quality science. talked
fact that, least experiments himself, ingestion vinegar not
seem blunt blood glucose, using continuous glucose monitors.
incidentally, another example Ferris early game rest us
kind just wake. talked use blood glucose monitors, those,
think time implanted skin. Nowadays less invasive blood
glucose monitors, things like Levels forth, actually becoming pretty
popular. worn one before. actually pretty informative. learned
instance, go sauna experience sharp rise blood glucose.
makes sense dehydration associated sauna,
lot sweating, concentration sugar bloodstream goes up.
things certain foods affect blood glucose one way another. kind
interesting fun experiment might interested well.
Regardless, now data pointing fact lemon juice lime juice,
couple tablespoons so, ingested before, even during, even after, consumption
sugary foods, say foods sharply increase blood glucose large
carbohydrate meals, can actually blunt blood glucose response. see
experiments continuous glucose monitor, kind
fun experiments. preferred experiments eating somewhat
larger meals things didn't contain lot sugar. saw big increases blood
glucose certain instances, ingest lemon juice lime juice,


typically mixed water. sure enough, see blunting blood

explore it. will say, fasting already low blood glucose,
ingest lemon juice, say lemon juice water lime juice water,
careful can actually become hypoglycemic. reasons
lemon juice lime juice can blunt blood glucose blood glucose

impossible, least safe way, become quote unquote
alkaline ingesting alkaline water something like that. true pH,
alkalinity acidity varies different compartments body, important.
Unless hemorrhaging vomiting, something badly wrong you,
health wise, really dire circumstance, don't want big shifts

simply ingesting something sour, changing way sweet things impact
brain. think stands reason lemon juice/lime juice effect not
going magic. going everything way ingesting sour
foods can adjust taste. Excuse me, can adjust neural response taste sweet
foods. fact, know based beautiful work Charles Zuker Columbia
Medical School, exactly happens. measured activity
neurons various locations so-called taste pathways brain. found
particular tastes like just sweet just bitter just sour evoke certain
ensembles neurons fire particular sequences, sweet sour co-
ingested, bitter sour co-ingested, get distinct ensembles, meaning
distinct patterns activity neurons. course, distinct patterns
downstream activity within brain body. still somewhat mysterious
exactly things like lemon juice lime juice can reduce blood glucose
spikes. ingest sweet foods carbohydrate laden foods, big
meals, can use tool understanding grounding
biology way circuits work.

01:43:09 Tool: Reduce Sugar Cravings & Spikes Cinnamon

Now, probably heard cinnamon can useful tool controlling
blood sugar. indeed case. clear cinnamon can adjust rate
glucose entry stream, possibly changing rate gastric emptying,
might slow rate gastric emptying thereby also reduce glycemic index
particular foods. suppose going eat mango, hadn't just done
bunch hard training, might sprinkle cinnamon here. always enjoy kind
coming new ideas ways can eat foods podcasts.
event, debate there, look online whether not Saigon
Cinnamon, Cassia cinnamon, excuse me, Ceylon cinnamon best purposes
blunting blood glucose spikes. think the, least read data


found, doesn't really matter provided real cinnamon.
actually look make sure real cinnamon, lot cinnamon
buy not real. want provide cautionary note cinnamon however.
Cinnamon contains something called coumarin. can toxic high levels.
don't want ingest teaspoon, maybe teaspoon half
cinnamon per day, start exceed threshold cinnamon
start problematic. certainly going big meal meal
lot sugar it, lot carbohydrate laden foods, don't want increase
blood glucose, put cinnamon beverage, put cinnamon
food order blunt blood glucose increase, reduce glycemic index way
reducing gastric emptying time. Again, just making sure don't get past
one half teaspoons per day, 'cause really don't want start dealing
toxicity related coumarin. talked lemon juice lime juice
cinnamon, kind commonplace many kitchens. course can
venture esoteric say advanced tools

01:45:10 Berberine, Sustained Low Blood Glucose Levels

adjusting sugar intake. one comes mind course Berberine.
Berberine derivative tree bark very, potent substance reducing
blood glucose. much par Metformin Glibenclamide,
prescription drugs specifically used reduce blood glucose. using Berberine
serious step, absolutely talk doctor it. know number
people use lower blood glucose eat really large meals. know
number people using get effects Metformin
people discussed, things like activating tapping so-called AMPK
pathway, reducing mTOR, people aiming activities increasing
longevity, somewhat controversial approach, still, know many people it.
true ingest Berberine, blood glucose will plummet. point
actually tried before, gave brutal headaches felt really
dizzy, felt like couldn't see straight. actually couldn't see straight,
that? Well, made hypoglycemic. actually drove blood glucose
far. reason took Berberine empty stomach. know
people can tolerate it. say, cautious ingesting Berberine


empty stomach, low carbohydrate diet, unless really know
medical professional kind guide that.
took Berberine along large meal, included lot carbohydrates,
know, can recall days Costello eat couple pizzas
might get ice cream, kind thing. felt perfectly fine even 750
milligrams gram Berberine. kind unique property making feel
not overwhelmed amount blood glucose increase experiencing
eating big meal. don't quite know else describe it. almost can
keep eating eating eating, course protect gastric

using gorge food, just heard it, interested experimenting it.
don't chronic blood sugar issues. again, took empty
stomach, made hypoglycemic low carbohydrate intake, hypoglycemic, not
good experience. again, experience think avoid. provided lot
glucose bloodstream, certainly experimental type
trying regulate blood glucose, Berberine might good option. again, talk
doctor. interesting effects terms lowering total
cholesterol research supported reducing insulin little bit. Well, not
surprising reduce blood glucose, going reduce insulin course,
insulin manages blood glucose bloodstream. place Berberine
course, Metformin Glibenclamide kind heavy hitting potent tools
regulating blood glucose. Now, episode, not sugar per se, sugar
viewed lens nervous system. interesting Berberine,
Metformin, Glibenclamide related substances, effects
course gastric emptying buffering blood glucose within bloodstream, et cetera.
appeared also neural effects chronically low glucose
blunting blood glucose things like Berberine. neural effects
include longstanding changes hormonal cascades consequence
low blood sugar thereby, changes neural circuits manage blood

blood glucose, either not ingesting heavily carbohydrate laden foods.
speaking low carb ketogenic types blunting blood glucose
things like Metformin Berberine, even ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even
sugars, time, seems adjustment, call homeostatic


regulation neural circuits control things like sugar craving, indeed,
people report feeling fewer sugar cravings time. Now didn't use Berberine

longstanding changes neural circuitry regulates blood sugar time.
might welcome changes, right? Reduce sugar cravings instance.
really, really serious modulating blood glucose things like
Berberine, typical dose range, again, anywhere half gram 1.5 grams
daily, typical dosages explored.
substances like sodium caprate known augment effects Berberine via
AMPK pathways. basically can increase ability Berberine
glucose lowering actions. course getting really potent,
call sharp blade tools controlling blood glucose. listen, anytime dealing
blood glucose, dealing brain's preferred source fuel. anytime
dealing brain's preferred source fuel, especially
cautious depriving brain needs. whether not low carb,
high carb, know, keto, vegan, carnivore, substances, like Berberine, very,
potent need take seriously.

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called

01:43:09 Tool: Reduce Sugar Cravings & Spikes Cinnamon

Now, probably heard cinnamon can useful tool controlling
blood sugar. indeed case. clear cinnamon can adjust rate
glucose entry stream, possibly changing rate gastric emptying,
might slow rate gastric emptying thereby also reduce glycemic index

found, doesn't really matter provided real cinnamon.
actually look make sure real cinnamon, lot cinnamon
buy not real. want provide cautionary note cinnamon however.
Cinnamon contains something called coumarin. can toxic high levels.
don't want ingest teaspoon, maybe teaspoon half
cinnamon per day, start exceed threshold cinnamon
start problematic. certainly going big meal meal
lot sugar it, lot carbohydrate laden foods, don't want increase

01:45:10 Berberine, Sustained Low Blood Glucose Levels

adjusting sugar intake. one comes mind course Berberine.
Berberine derivative tree bark very, potent substance reducing
blood glucose. much par Metformin Glibenclamide,
prescription drugs specifically used reduce blood glucose. using Berberine
serious step, absolutely talk doctor it. know number
people use lower blood glucose eat really large meals. know
number people using get effects Metformin
people discussed, things like activating tapping so-called AMPK
pathway, reducing mTOR, people aiming activities increasing
longevity, somewhat controversial approach, still, know many people it.
true ingest Berberine, blood glucose will plummet. point
actually tried before, gave brutal headaches felt really
dizzy, felt like couldn't see straight. actually couldn't see straight,
that? Well, made hypoglycemic. actually drove blood glucose
far. reason took Berberine empty stomach. know
people can tolerate it. say, cautious ingesting Berberine


empty stomach, low carbohydrate diet, unless really know

don't chronic blood sugar issues. again, took empty
stomach, made hypoglycemic low carbohydrate intake, hypoglycemic, not
good experience. again, experience think avoid. provided lot
glucose bloodstream, certainly experimental type
trying regulate blood glucose, Berberine might good option. again, talk
doctor. interesting effects terms lowering total
cholesterol research supported reducing insulin little bit. Well, not
surprising reduce blood glucose, going reduce insulin course,
insulin manages blood glucose bloodstream. place Berberine
course, Metformin Glibenclamide kind heavy hitting potent tools
regulating blood glucose. Now, episode, not sugar per se, sugar
viewed lens nervous system. interesting Berberine,
Metformin, Glibenclamide related substances, effects
course gastric emptying buffering blood glucose within bloodstream, et cetera.
appeared also neural effects chronically low glucose
blunting blood glucose things like Berberine. neural effects
include longstanding changes hormonal cascades consequence
low blood sugar thereby, changes neural circuits manage blood

blood glucose, either not ingesting heavily carbohydrate laden foods.
speaking low carb ketogenic types blunting blood glucose
things like Metformin Berberine, even ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even
sugars, time, seems adjustment, call homeostatic


regulation neural circuits control things like sugar craving, indeed,
people report feeling fewer sugar cravings time. Now didn't use Berberine
long period time, never used Metformin. experienced somewhat odd
welcome phenomenon progressive year life, fewer

Berberine Metformin otherwise, addition working doctor, think
understand it, right. think many effects can quite
potent. can happen immediate term terms regulating blood
glucose, can send hypoglycemic aren't careful, can also cause
longstanding changes neural circuitry regulates blood sugar time.
might welcome changes, right? Reduce sugar cravings instance.
really, really serious modulating blood glucose things like
Berberine, typical dose range, again, anywhere half gram 1.5 grams
daily, typical dosages explored.
substances like sodium caprate known augment effects Berberine via
AMPK pathways. basically can increase ability Berberine
glucose lowering actions. course getting really potent,
call sharp blade tools controlling blood glucose. listen, anytime dealing
blood glucose, dealing brain's preferred source fuel. anytime
dealing brain's preferred source fuel, especially
cautious depriving brain needs. whether not low carb,
high carb, know, keto, vegan, carnivore, substances, like Berberine, very,
potent need take seriously.

01:51:24 Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings

yet another tool controlling sugar cravings neural circuits
regulate sugar craving downstream consequences. tool
call high performance tool, one probably didn't suspect
sleep. done extensive episodes sleep, actually episode called
master sleep. can find episode easily hubermanlab.com. available
various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. provides lot tools.
social media, provide lot tools, often newsletter provides


tools maximize sleep. role sleep sugar metabolism, sugar,
hunger, way brain regulates things? Well, really exciting
study came just last year. study published journal, Cell Report,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal. reason love study much,
involved people, yes, done humans, sleep laboratory.
not unusual, sleep lab Stanford, sleep labs elsewhere.
actually measured breath people, extracted
breath, metabolites allow understand sorts
metabolism occurring people's bodies different phases sleep.
really remarkable study. actually every 10 seconds throughout
entire night. little tiny 10 second bits, meaning high resolution,
evaluate metabolism brain body people experience go
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep slow wave, sleep, on. go
deeper study future, interesting, think
important. discovered stage sleep associated
particular signature pattern metabolism particular phases sleep
associated sugar metabolism, fat metabolism,
aspects metabolism. reason think study important discuss
context today's discussion sugar brain, many people
experienced effects disrupted sleep appetite. particular,
reported people sleep deprived quality sleep disrupted,
appetite sugary food increases. Now always assumed due
metabolic need triggered sleep deprivation poor sleep.
reading study, important points made authors
relate fact well, sleep known incredibly important effects brain

organized sequence particular forms metabolism active particular
phases sleep, very, well orchestrated, know, slow wave sleep,
REM sleep orchestrated 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles
forth, thought perhaps set brain body able regulate
waking hours. therefore, people sleep deprived deprived
certain forms states within sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, creates
disruption particular set metabolic pathways. Now don't leap far
study sugar metabolism neural circuits controlling sugar metabolism. will


say this, look sum total data obesity type two diabetes

plethora data pointing fact getting quality sleep night helps regulate
not appetite, also specific forms metabolism drive specific appetites.
takeaway is, extravagant potent interesting ways
regulate blood glucose, everything cinnamon lemon juice, Berberine,
sodium caprate, behavioral tools, mere understanding direct
indirect pathways go gut dopamine, et cetera, not establishing
