going focus learn skills quickly particular motor skills. will also
translate things like musical skills playing instruments, mainly going
focus physical movements body extend beyond hands like just playing
piano fingers like playing guitar. everything going talk
will also serve formation consolidation performance types
skills. interested perform better, whether not dance yoga
even something just repetitive like running swimming, podcast

going talk specific protocols science points verified,
allow learn quickly embed learning remember
able build skills quickly otherwise. also going touch
things get asked lot, fortunately recently time
go deep literature, extract data mental visualization.
visualizing particular skill practice serve learning consolidation

00:08:40 Clarification Cold, Heat & Caffeine

get started. get topic skill learning tools accelerating
skill learning, want briefly revisit topic temperature covered
last episode just highlight things clear misunderstandings.
last episode talked incredible data colleague, Craig Heller's lab
Stanford. department biology, showing cooling palms particular
ways particular times can allow athletes just recreational exercisers
pull-ups, dips, bench presses per unit time, run further, cycle feel
better it. really incredible data anchored biology
vascular system, blood supply involved cooling us. Many you,
dozens fact said, "Wait second, gave us protocol episode "which
says cool palms periodically "throughout exercise order able


work. "But episode, growth hormone "and thyroid
hormone, said heating body "is good release growth hormone."
just want clarify things true. two separate protocols.
always warm exercise. warmup will not increase body
temperature muscle temperature point going diminish
work capacity, going harm performance. cooling palms,
really just route cool core efficient way, efficient way, fact
improving performance. Heating body exercise focusing heat

palms periodically described previous episode going way
go. interested getting growth hormone release, well hot sauna.
offered tools don't sauna episode growth hormone
thyroid hormone going way go. separate protocols.
can include fitness regime training regime, want
separate times. last point this, also mentioned caffeine can
either help hinder performance depending whether not caffeine adapted
ways caffeine impacts body temperature sorts things like
vasodilation constriction. simple. enjoy caffeine workouts
accustomed caffeine, meaning drink three five times
week. 100 300 milligrams typical daily dose caffeine.
ingesting more, less. regularly, well, going just fine
ingest caffeine train. not going impact body temperature
vasodilation constriction ways will hinder you. However, not regular
caffeine user thinking, "Oh, going drink cup coffee "and get
huge performance enhancing effect." Well, not going happen. Chances
going lead increases body temperature changes way blood flow

swing tennis swing shooting free throws learning dance
learning instrument. mainly going focus athletic performance.
basically two types skills. Open loop closed loop. Open loop skills skills
perform sort motor action wait get immediate
feedback whether not done correctly not. good example will
throwing darts dartboard. throw dart, get feedback whether
not hit bullseye, off dart board, location
dart board, open loop. Closed loop something continuous.
say runner starting speed work sprints.
running can kind feel whether not running correctly,
maybe even coach correcting stride trying
sort skill, like hopscotch skill, maybe ladder work
stepping designated spaces ground. closed loop
go, can adjust behavior can adjust distance steps,
can adjust speed can adjust posture able
essentially practice per unit time getting feedback moment

open loop practicing tennis serve. say set target

loop. know whether not court, location


wanted hit close not, open loop. Closed loop
regular can. maybe learning swim stroke, maybe trying learn
particular rhythm drum. maybe trying learn particular beat. not
musical, not going embarrass giving example this,
although later will, trying get particular rhythm down. not
getting it, can adjust real time try catch slow speed up, et
cetera. hopefully understand open loop closed loop. always
know try learn skill, whether not open loop closed loop
return important shortly.

00:18:50 Three Key Components Skill

want learn something, ask open loop closed loop.
essentially three components skill involves motor movement.
sensory perception, actually perceiving happening
around you. see, hear, sometimes paying attention
specifically like trajectory arm moving feet.
learning dance, sometimes focused something happening
outside you, like listening something music paying attention
way partner moving, et cetera. sensory input.
actual movements. movements limbs body.
something called proprioception proprioception often discussed kind sixth
sense knowing limbs relation body. proprioception
vitally important. reached pick pen pick up, not thinking
pen hand relative body, proprioceptively, aware
kind six sense deeper subconscious level. can also make aware
limbs are. typically learn, placing focus
proprioception ordinarily. get chair happen walk
room, don't think feet landing relative one another.
leg fallen asleep leaning one nerves leg
something like that, leg feels tingly numb. you, happen
you, immediately notice shift gait. feel strange, pay
attention stepping. reason not getting proprioceptive
feedback. Now, skill learning lot dimensions too, main


ones going focus on. just remind you, need know open loop
closed loop need know whether not, excuse me, need know
sensory perception

00:21:00 Sources Control Movement: 1) CPGs Govern Rhythmic Learned
Behavior

paying attention to, movements proprioception.
one important thing need know movement kind
generated one, two three sources within nervous system, within brain
body. central pattern generators sometimes called CSPGs,
excuse me, CPGSs, CSPGs something entirely different biology. CPGSs, just
goes show module. CSPGs chondroid sulfate proteoglycans.
nothing topic. CPGSs central pattern generators CPGs,
sometimes called. CPGs spinal cord, mine yours, different
ones generate repetitive movements. walking, running,
cycling, breathing, presumably
regular rhythmic cadence, central pattern generators controlling movement.
learn walk, run, swim, cycle, anything really, much work
handed off central pattern generators. experiments done
60s, 70s 80s actually looked decerebrate animals even
decerebrate humans. humans animals lack cerebral cortex.
lack much brain yet can engage called fictive movement.
sounds like kind barbaric experiment. glad wasn't one
stuff neuroscience textbooks cats dogs mice
neocortex removed put treadmill, walk just fine. will adjust
speed walking just fine even though basically lack thinking
decision-making brain. turns humans have, unfortunately, massive
strokes cortex lack neocortex preserve central pattern
generators will also walk just fine, even though lack stuff
brain. CPGs CPGSs amazing, control lot already
learned behavior. really good something, CPGs controlling lot
behavior. true also golf swing. Even not really repetitive,



00:23:30 Upper Motor Neurons Deliberate Movement & Learning

somebody really good golf going to, guess call T. put ball
T. show knowledge golf. done mini golf, frankly,
someday maybe learn golf, set golf ball swing, set
golf ball down, swing. Central pattern generators going handle lot that.
go golf course. Stanford beautiful golf course. go
put ball T, central pattern generators not involved
all. moment bring club back swing, going engage things.
things going engage don't know behavior now
upper motor neurons. motor neurons cortex, neocortex control
deliberate action. ones engaging learning.
ones pay attention order engage.
happening, instance, decide going reach pick pen,
rarely think about, now thinking going
deliberate way. going grab two fingers lift. upper motor neurons
now involved. upper motor neurons important little bit later
episode talk use visualization order accelerate skill
learning, going leverage upper motor neurons particular ways.
CPGs rhythmic movement,

00:25:00 Lower Motor Neurons Control Action Execution

upper motor neurons deliberate unlearned movements movements
process learning. called lower motor neurons. Lower
motor neurons ones spinal cord send little wires muscles
actually caused firing muscle fibers. way think
got upper motor neurons talk CPGs lower motor neurons.
really simple. now, know everything know

00:25:26 Focus Learning

neural pathways controlling movement, least sake discussion.
anytime learn something, decide place sensory perception


on, meaning going focus on. critical listening
type person likes taking notes, second question
ask. Remember first question is, open loop closed loop? second question
be, focus attention on, auditory attention, visual attention
proprioception. focus limbs relative body
focus outcome? critical distinction. can decide learn
golf swing learn shoot free throws learn dance tango decide
going focus movements partner positions feet.
maybe going look them, maybe going sense them. going
actually feel are, maybe going sense position posture
body, proprioception. allocate attention.
going tell allocate attention best order learn faster.
sorts decisions make. Fortunately you, don't
think whether not going use upper motor neurons lower
motor neurons not, don't know something,
automatically going engage upper motor neurons. do, not
going use upper motor neurons. mainly going rely central pattern
generators. always using lower motor neurons move muscle. can
really simplify things now. given lot information can simplify it.
Basically open loop closed loop, one question

00:27:10 Reality Skill Learning & 10,000 Hours Myth

going focus on? neurology will take care rest.
now want talk realistic expectations. Somewhere Hollywood presumably,
got embedded somebody's mind instant skill acquisition possible,
take particular pill touch particular object
wand wave suddenly skill. result
Hollywood all. doesn't exist, least not reality. love movies, simply
doesn't exist. self-help literature created another rule called 10,000 hours
rule. frankly, doesn't really match literature, least scientific literature
either. like implies learning takes time, accurate
Hollywood instant skill acquisition rule, isn't really rule, myth.
10,000 hours rule overlook something crucial, not hours,


repetitions.

00:28:30 Repetitions & Super Mario Effect: Error Signals vs. Error Signals +
Punishment

Now, course relationship time repetitions,
beautiful experiments point fact simple adjustment
focused attempt learn new skill, can adjust number repetitions
do, adjust motivation learning can vastly accelerate
learning. may recognize internet name, not scientific
term, super Mario effect. actually quite good video YouTube
describing super Mario effect. think YouTuber think
background science interesting experiment. talk
experiment first will talk neurobiology supports result
got. super Mario effect relates game super Mario brothers, see
end. basically 50,000 subjects,
enormous number subjects learn program, essentially taking words computer
program commands computer program kind clustered
column right. sorts things computer programmers will
familiar people won't. commands essentially,
essentially translate things like go forward. right hand turn
maze, go right continue hit choice point, et cetera. bunch
instructions, job subjects experiments organize
instructions particular way allow little cursor move main
successfully. basically goal was, least subjects told
anyone can learn computer program. somebody can just organize
instructions right way, can program little cursor move
amaze, simple. yet, don't background computer
programming, even do, takes skill. know commands
give particular order. made easy. just assemble
list onto right. people started this. Now two
groups one half subjects, got wrong, meaning entered
command cursor move wrong command little cursor
move maze, saw signal jump screen said,


not work, please try again. it, put wrong command wrong
sequence, it'll say not work please try again. subjects
reorganize instructions little cursor continue. got
wrong again, say not work, please try again. half
subjects, got something wrong told just lost five points, please continue.
So, difference feedback got. Now confess,
predicted based knowledge dopamine circuitry reward
contingency epinephrin stress motivated learning. thing
told many many books behavioral economics self-help
literature, people will work much harder prevent losing something
will gain something, hear time. turns not
happened. looked success rate subjects, found
subjects told not work, please try again, 68% success
rate. 68% went successfully program cursor moving maze.
Whereas ones told lost five points 52% success rate,
significant difference. source success lack success really
interesting. subjects told not work, please try again, tried many,
many times per unit time. words, made attempts
programming thing allow cursor move maze. Whereas
people told lost five points gave earlier gave entirely. Okay,
just step back me, surprising. violates lot
things heard kind popular culture self-help literature people
will work much harder avoid losing something will gain something.
didn't really fit understood reward contingencies dopamine,
fit well another set experiments familiar
neuroscience literature. give punchline first. going take
data mean going talk learning protocol can use
will allow learn skills faster willingly participating repetitions

00:34:00 Learning Win, Every Time

time. experiment want tell called
tube test. generally done mice, although sometimes done rats


lot parallels things probably seen experienced
even human life, regular life, maybe even life. experiment.
take two rats, put tube two mice, put tube. mice
rats, don't like share tube. start pushing
back forth, back forth. Sooner later, one rats mice
pushes one out. one got pushed loser, one gets
tube winner. Now take winner, give new competitor.
find mouse rat won previously much higher chance
probability winning second time. words, winning leads winning
again. reverse also true. take loser put loser
another mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse, loser typically will lose much greater
probability chance. not related differences strength size
testosterone things might leap mind explanations

three years ago, paper published Journal Science, phenomenal
journal. one three apex journals, examined brain area involved
this. Turns particular area frontal cortex want know.
simple experiment experimenters increased decreased

reason bringing today reason bringing heels
super Mario effect stimulation brain area simple
important effect, was, led forward steps, repetitions, effort,
not terms sheer might will, not digging deeper, just repetitions per unit
time. losers fewer repetitions per unit time. super Mario effect,
online experiment tube test, done various labs repeated


point simple important rule, neither 10,000
hours rule magic wand Hollywood version learning. rather neuro-
biological explanation learning skill want perform many repetitions per
unit time, possibly can. least first trying learn skill. want
repeat that, want perform many repetitions possibly can least
first trying learn skill. Now might sound like duh, just reps,
not obvious. no reason repetitions necessarily lead
faster learning also say, well, repetitions, can make
errors errors lead poor performance like misstepping number
times. cases, little feedback. not like every time rat
pushes forward moves back sensing, oh winning, losing, winning,
losing micro level. probably starts push one
rat mouse probably thinks, "I'm winning." backing up, probably thinks,
"I'm losing." play game, super Mario game, told, nope, didn't
work. Nope, didn't work, please try again. important thing winners
always generating repetitions per unit time. just repeat performance,
repeat performance even errors. points something vitally
important, reps important making error reps also important. fact,
might important factor. talk errors solve
problem focus on. said earlier, want learn something,
need know open loop closed loop need know focus on,
place perception.

00:39:26 Errors Solve Problem Focus Trying Learn Skills

seems like tough task errors will tell exactly focus on.
talk errors can leverage errors accelerate skill learning. Okay,
established performing maximum number repetitions per training
session going advantageous. might seem obvious
shadowy side that, is, well want just repeat thing
getting wrong, 90% time. reason errors
actually cue nervous system two things; one error correction
opens door window neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity brain
nervous system's ability change response experience, essentially custom


modify order perform anything better. entire month
neuroplasticity talked little bit errors important. Now
going make concrete operationalize it, make actionable.
paper published 2021 Norman all. important
paper. published Journal Neuron cell press journal, excellent
journal. title paper gives away essentially, post error recruitment
frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention. Now, says
make error, causes activation brain areas anchor attention.
Remember need perception, attention, essentially thing.

Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue
frontal cortex networks, call top-down processing neuromodulators,
things like dopamine acetylcholine epinephrin will allow plasticity.

probably wondering,

00:43:00 Increasing Baseline Levels Dopamine Prior Learning Bad



not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete
repetitions. Now, just elevate basil level
dopamine taking, don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine something,
bad increase dopamine actually much lower. say
delta smaller. signal noise smaller overall levels dopamine very,
high.

doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion



01:11:06 Move Intermediate Advanced Skill Execution faster:
Metronomes

nailed every time, problem no ball. already
fair degree proficiency, skill given practice sport instrument.
sort advanced intermediate advanced levels proficiency something,
practice can find interesting data literature, involves
metronoming. realize relates generating repetitions relates
tone experiment doesn't really matter attention cued long
performing many many reps motor sequence. can use metronome
obviously musicians this, athletes can too. can use metronome
set cadence repetitions. Now swimmers, actually device.
able find online, forgot brand name not about,
actually goes swim cap can cue need perform
another stroke. runners, metronome type devices
headphones tone room running indoors treadmill
cue basically need lift heels. that,
athletes find can perform repetitions, can generate output,
can increase speed. number really interesting things done auditory
metronoming. involved little bit work now hopefully able
report back using stroboscopic metronoming. actually changing
speed visual environment. fun experiments, basically changing one's
perception fast moving space playing visual system,
something future discussion. can start use auditory metronoming
generating movements per unit time generating errors therefore
successes neuroplasticity. number different apps
there. found several free apps can set metronome pace, might
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.
know world championship cup stacking. young lady saw
take cups spread table basically just stack


perfect pyramid least amount times kids go wild. something
never thought pursue frankly never will pursue unless life depends
reason, really impressive. look sequence 'cause
recorded, can look YouTube. find
expert cup stackers, just error elimination. two metronomic
auditory cues can actually cue pick cups faster ordinarily
learn that. can anything. think cup stacking probably not
skill interested doing, skill, figure rate
performing repetitions per unit time want increase slightly,
set metronome slightly faster current rate just start
generating repetitions. Now interesting cool relates
back experiment Lappe colleagues, attention now
harnessed tone, metronome, not necessarily terms
motor movement. really need bit proficiency. Again,
people intermediate advanced intermediate advanced.
essentially creating outside pressure, contingency
generate, again, errors. errors get. Now, aren't
errors cups tumble stop can't keep up,
set pace just little bit beyond currently can do. that,
essentially forcing nervous system make errors correct errors
inside session. find really interesting means is,
got sensory perception, paying attention to, proprioception limbs
motor neurons upper lower motor neurons central pattern
generators. can't pay attention to, "Well, upper motor neurons,
"they're lower motor neurons." Forget that, not going that. can't pay
attention proprioception much. super slow motion
proprioception. harness attention something.
harness attention outside contingency, metronome firing off

horses like trot, gallop on, next thing. Clearly,
don't know anything horses except beautiful liked

slowly breaks jog full sprint gallop horse,
actually engaging different central pattern generators. central pattern

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days

00:18:50 Three Key Components Skill

want learn something, ask open loop closed loop.
essentially three components skill involves motor movement.
sensory perception, actually perceiving happening
around you. see, hear, sometimes paying attention
specifically like trajectory arm moving feet.
learning dance, sometimes focused something happening
outside you, like listening something music paying attention
way partner moving, et cetera. sensory input.
actual movements. movements limbs body.
something called proprioception proprioception often discussed kind sixth
sense knowing limbs relation body. proprioception
vitally important. reached pick pen pick up, not thinking
pen hand relative body, proprioceptively, aware
kind six sense deeper subconscious level. can also make aware
limbs are. typically learn, placing focus
proprioception ordinarily. get chair happen walk
room, don't think feet landing relative one another.
leg fallen asleep leaning one nerves leg
something like that, leg feels tingly numb. you, happen
you, immediately notice shift gait. feel strange, pay
attention stepping. reason not getting proprioceptive
feedback. Now, skill learning lot dimensions too, main


ones going focus on. just remind you, need know open loop
closed loop need know whether not, excuse me, need know
sensory perception

00:21:00 Sources Control Movement: 1) CPGs Govern Rhythmic Learned
Behavior

paying attention to, movements proprioception.
one important thing need know movement kind
generated one, two three sources within nervous system, within brain
body. central pattern generators sometimes called CSPGs,
excuse me, CPGSs, CSPGs something entirely different biology. CPGSs, just
goes show module. CSPGs chondroid sulfate proteoglycans.
nothing topic. CPGSs central pattern generators CPGs,
sometimes called. CPGs spinal cord, mine yours, different
ones generate repetitive movements. walking, running,
cycling, breathing, presumably
regular rhythmic cadence, central pattern generators controlling movement.
learn walk, run, swim, cycle, anything really, much work
handed off central pattern generators. experiments done
60s, 70s 80s actually looked decerebrate animals even
decerebrate humans. humans animals lack cerebral cortex.

piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper

Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor

obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line

words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

00:18:50 Three Key Components Skill

want learn something, ask open loop closed loop.
essentially three components skill involves motor movement.
sensory perception, actually perceiving happening
around you. see, hear, sometimes paying attention
specifically like trajectory arm moving feet.
learning dance, sometimes focused something happening
outside you, like listening something music paying attention
way partner moving, et cetera. sensory input.
actual movements. movements limbs body.
something called proprioception proprioception often discussed kind sixth
sense knowing limbs relation body. proprioception
vitally important. reached pick pen pick up, not thinking
pen hand relative body, proprioceptively, aware
kind six sense deeper subconscious level. can also make aware
limbs are. typically learn, placing focus
proprioception ordinarily. get chair happen walk
room, don't think feet landing relative one another.
leg fallen asleep leaning one nerves leg
something like that, leg feels tingly numb. you, happen
you, immediately notice shift gait. feel strange, pay
attention stepping. reason not getting proprioceptive
feedback. Now, skill learning lot dimensions too, main


ones going focus on. just remind you, need know open loop

piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper

paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop

get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot

00:18:50 Three Key Components Skill

want learn something, ask open loop closed loop.
essentially three components skill involves motor movement.
sensory perception, actually perceiving happening
around you. see, hear, sometimes paying attention
specifically like trajectory arm moving feet.
learning dance, sometimes focused something happening
outside you, like listening something music paying attention
way partner moving, et cetera. sensory input.

either. like implies learning takes time, accurate
Hollywood instant skill acquisition rule, isn't really rule, myth.
10,000 hours rule overlook something crucial, not hours,

anyone can learn computer program. somebody can just organize
instructions right way, can program little cursor move
amaze, simple. yet, don't background computer
programming, even do, takes skill. know commands

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years

make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill

proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,

talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain

essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

00:18:50 Three Key Components Skill

want learn something, ask open loop closed loop.
essentially three components skill involves motor movement.
sensory perception, actually perceiving happening
around you. see, hear, sometimes paying attention
specifically like trajectory arm moving feet.
learning dance, sometimes focused something happening
outside you, like listening something music paying attention
way partner moving, et cetera. sensory input.
actual movements. movements limbs body.
something called proprioception proprioception often discussed kind sixth
sense knowing limbs relation body. proprioception
vitally important. reached pick pen pick up, not thinking
pen hand relative body, proprioceptively, aware
kind six sense deeper subconscious level. can also make aware
limbs are. typically learn, placing focus
proprioception ordinarily. get chair happen walk
room, don't think feet landing relative one another.
leg fallen asleep leaning one nerves leg
something like that, leg feels tingly numb. you, happen
you, immediately notice shift gait. feel strange, pay
attention stepping. reason not getting proprioceptive
feedback. Now, skill learning lot dimensions too, main


ones going focus on. just remind you, need know open loop

get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion



01:11:06 Move Intermediate Advanced Skill Execution faster:
Metronomes

nailed every time, problem no ball. already
fair degree proficiency, skill given practice sport instrument.
sort advanced intermediate advanced levels proficiency something,
practice can find interesting data literature, involves
metronoming. realize relates generating repetitions relates
tone experiment doesn't really matter attention cued long
performing many many reps motor sequence. can use metronome
obviously musicians this, athletes can too. can use metronome
set cadence repetitions. Now swimmers, actually device.
able find online, forgot brand name not about,
actually goes swim cap can cue need perform
another stroke. runners, metronome type devices
headphones tone room running indoors treadmill
cue basically need lift heels. that,
athletes find can perform repetitions, can generate output,
can increase speed. number really interesting things done auditory
metronoming. involved little bit work now hopefully able
report back using stroboscopic metronoming. actually changing
speed visual environment. fun experiments, basically changing one's
perception fast moving space playing visual system,
something future discussion. can start use auditory metronoming
generating movements per unit time generating errors therefore
successes neuroplasticity. number different apps
there. found several free apps can set metronome pace, might
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.
know world championship cup stacking. young lady saw
take cups spread table basically just stack


perfect pyramid least amount times kids go wild. something
never thought pursue frankly never will pursue unless life depends
reason, really impressive. look sequence 'cause
recorded, can look YouTube. find
expert cup stackers, just error elimination. two metronomic
auditory cues can actually cue pick cups faster ordinarily
learn that. can anything. think cup stacking probably not
skill interested doing, skill, figure rate
performing repetitions per unit time want increase slightly,
set metronome slightly faster current rate just start
generating repetitions. Now interesting cool relates
back experiment Lappe colleagues, attention now
harnessed tone, metronome, not necessarily terms

people intermediate advanced intermediate advanced.

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence

beginners, trying focus attention things

focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing

repeat that, want perform many repetitions possibly can least
first trying learn skill. Now might sound like duh, just reps,
not obvious. no reason repetitions necessarily lead
faster learning also say, well, repetitions, can make
errors errors lead poor performance like misstepping number
times. cases, little feedback. not like every time rat
pushes forward moves back sensing, oh winning, losing, winning,

always generating repetitions per unit time. just repeat performance,
repeat performance even errors. points something vitally
important, reps important making error reps also important. fact,
might important factor. talk errors solve

need know open loop closed loop need know focus on,
place perception.

00:39:26 Errors Solve Problem Focus Trying Learn Skills

seems like tough task errors will tell exactly focus on.
talk errors can leverage errors accelerate skill learning. Okay,
established performing maximum number repetitions per training
session going advantageous. might seem obvious
shadowy side that, is, well want just repeat thing
getting wrong, 90% time. reason errors
actually cue nervous system two things; one error correction
opens door window neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity brain
nervous system's ability change response experience, essentially custom


modify order perform anything better. entire month
neuroplasticity talked little bit errors important. Now
going make concrete operationalize it, make actionable.
paper published 2021 Norman all. important
paper. published Journal Neuron cell press journal, excellent
journal. title paper gives away essentially, post error recruitment
frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention. Now, says
make error, causes activation brain areas anchor attention.
Remember need perception, attention, essentially thing.
need proprioception need upper lower motor neurons communicate
proper ways. vital question pay attention to. Errors tell
nervous system something needs change. performing task
skill like learning dance stepping person's toes
fumbling not getting right, errors opening possibility
plasticity. walk away point, made exact wrong choice. Unless
errors somehow hazardous health somebody else's wellbeing, want
continue engage high repetition rate. really learning possible.
Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue
frontal cortex networks, call top-down processing neuromodulators,
things like dopamine acetylcholine epinephrin will allow plasticity.
super Mario experiment, maze experiment focused generating
errors, telling people wasn't right, please try wasn't right, lost five
points. key distinction errors cued people fact
needed change something. trying learn new skill screwing
making mistakes, mistakes make, plastic
brain becomes get right, correct pattern will rewarded
consolidated. can trust will performance something
correctly associated release neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine
involved craving motivation. involved lot things, also involved
learning. will entire episode dopamine learning
probably wondering,

00:43:00 Increasing Baseline Levels Dopamine Prior Learning Bad



not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete

performing well every while, accomplishing better every

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years
ago. actually several papers now focused this. One
published 2018. Claudia Lappe colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. done
really nice work, talks influence pitch feedback learning

presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention

making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back

proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking

tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,

never great done alone compared actual physical execution

surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper

Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons

Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

repeat that, want perform many repetitions possibly can least
first trying learn skill. Now might sound like duh, just reps,
not obvious. no reason repetitions necessarily lead
faster learning also say, well, repetitions, can make
errors errors lead poor performance like misstepping number
times. cases, little feedback. not like every time rat
pushes forward moves back sensing, oh winning, losing, winning,

always generating repetitions per unit time. just repeat performance,
repeat performance even errors. points something vitally
important, reps important making error reps also important. fact,
might important factor. talk errors solve
problem focus on. said earlier, want learn something,
need know open loop closed loop need know focus on,
place perception.

00:39:26 Errors Solve Problem Focus Trying Learn Skills

seems like tough task errors will tell exactly focus on.
talk errors can leverage errors accelerate skill learning. Okay,
established performing maximum number repetitions per training
session going advantageous. might seem obvious
shadowy side that, is, well want just repeat thing
getting wrong, 90% time. reason errors
actually cue nervous system two things; one error correction
opens door window neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity brain
nervous system's ability change response experience, essentially custom


modify order perform anything better. entire month
neuroplasticity talked little bit errors important. Now
going make concrete operationalize it, make actionable.
paper published 2021 Norman all. important
paper. published Journal Neuron cell press journal, excellent
journal. title paper gives away essentially, post error recruitment
frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention. Now, says
make error, causes activation brain areas anchor attention.
Remember need perception, attention, essentially thing.
need proprioception need upper lower motor neurons communicate
proper ways. vital question pay attention to. Errors tell
nervous system something needs change. performing task
skill like learning dance stepping person's toes
fumbling not getting right, errors opening possibility
plasticity. walk away point, made exact wrong choice. Unless
errors somehow hazardous health somebody else's wellbeing, want
continue engage high repetition rate. really learning possible.
Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue
frontal cortex networks, call top-down processing neuromodulators,
things like dopamine acetylcholine epinephrin will allow plasticity.
super Mario experiment, maze experiment focused generating
errors, telling people wasn't right, please try wasn't right, lost five
points. key distinction errors cued people fact
needed change something. trying learn new skill screwing
making mistakes, mistakes make, plastic
brain becomes get right, correct pattern will rewarded
consolidated. can trust will performance something
correctly associated release neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine
involved craving motivation. involved lot things, also involved
learning. will entire episode dopamine learning
probably wondering,

00:43:00 Increasing Baseline Levels Dopamine Prior Learning Bad



not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete
repetitions. Now, just elevate basil level
dopamine taking, don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine something,
bad increase dopamine actually much lower. say
delta smaller. signal noise smaller overall levels dopamine very,
high.

00:44:40 Framing Effect (& Protocol Defined)

actually going learn less well. skill learning, motor skill learning,
increasing dopamine levels prior not good idea. might help motivation
get learning not going improve plasticity process likely
hinder it. important. errors cue brain something

00:46:10 Note & Warning Coaches

appropriate sensory events. Now, sometimes working coach.
shout coaches, thank do. However,
needs least scientific literature say. needs period
training session whereby athlete person kind can simply pay attention
errors without attention cued something else. really well-trained
coach will say, "Oh, elbows swinging high, "or not gripping racket "in
appropriate way," et cetera. can see things practitioner can't see.
course vitally important. practitioner also needs use error
recognition signal, need basically focus something errors going
tell focus on. put simply needs period time

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years

incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball

motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason

move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface

brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning

can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory

question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,

bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength

people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,

essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct

proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability

people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training

never great done alone compared actual physical execution

surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

talk errors can leverage errors accelerate skill learning. Okay,
established performing maximum number repetitions per training

shadowy side that, is, well want just repeat thing

neuroplasticity talked little bit errors important. Now
going make concrete operationalize it, make actionable.
paper published 2021 Norman all. important
paper. published Journal Neuron cell press journal, excellent

frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention. Now, says
make error, causes activation brain areas anchor attention.
Remember need perception, attention, essentially thing.

Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue

probably wondering,

00:43:00 Increasing Baseline Levels Dopamine Prior Learning Bad



not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete
repetitions. Now, just elevate basil level
dopamine taking, don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine something,
bad increase dopamine actually much lower. say

make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason

00:56:59 Pay Attention Striving Improve

high-level athlete, subsequent sessions get express gains
previous session, get perform well, presumably often even
just subtle. Sometimes there'll decrease performance, often
going perform better subsequent subsequent training sessions.
opportunity devote attention specific ways, not just let errors inform
place attention, rather direct perception particular elements
movement order accelerate learning further. clear, 'cause
know many interested concrete protocols. not just
let errors cue attention first session. might one session five
sessions, going depend. familiar something
performing well every while, accomplishing better every
while, can start cue attention deliberate ways. question
therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years
ago. actually several papers now focused this. One
published 2018. Claudia Lappe colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. done
really nice work, talks influence pitch feedback learning
motor timing sequencing. done piano carries athletic
performance well. going describe study you, describe it,
interesting study want know turns
doesn't matter much pay attention learning sequence provided
something related motor behavior performing. seems
incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct

proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,

talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability

people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting

never great done alone compared actual physical execution

surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

generous myself. post-training session let brain idle

presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention

making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct

proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano

keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key

paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open

get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct

obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success

motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off

cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move

learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students

that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.

always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

neuroplasticity talked little bit errors important. Now
going make concrete operationalize it, make actionable.
paper published 2021 Norman all. important
paper. published Journal Neuron cell press journal, excellent
journal. title paper gives away essentially, post error recruitment
frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention. Now, says
make error, causes activation brain areas anchor attention.
Remember need perception, attention, essentially thing.
need proprioception need upper lower motor neurons communicate
proper ways. vital question pay attention to. Errors tell
nervous system something needs change. performing task
skill like learning dance stepping person's toes
fumbling not getting right, errors opening possibility
plasticity. walk away point, made exact wrong choice. Unless
errors somehow hazardous health somebody else's wellbeing, want
continue engage high repetition rate. really learning possible.
Without errors, brain not position change itself. Errors actually cue
frontal cortex networks, call top-down processing neuromodulators,
things like dopamine acetylcholine epinephrin will allow plasticity.
super Mario experiment, maze experiment focused generating
errors, telling people wasn't right, please try wasn't right, lost five
points. key distinction errors cued people fact
needed change something. trying learn new skill screwing
making mistakes, mistakes make, plastic
brain becomes get right, correct pattern will rewarded
consolidated. can trust will performance something
correctly associated release neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine
involved craving motivation. involved lot things, also involved
learning. will entire episode dopamine learning
probably wondering,

00:43:00 Increasing Baseline Levels Dopamine Prior Learning Bad



not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete
repetitions. Now, just elevate basil level
dopamine taking, don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine something,
bad increase dopamine actually much lower. say
delta smaller. signal noise smaller overall levels dopamine very,
high.

00:46:10 Note & Warning Coaches

appropriate sensory events. Now, sometimes working coach.
shout coaches, thank do. However,
needs least scientific literature say. needs period
training session whereby athlete person kind can simply pay attention
errors without attention cued something else. really well-trained
coach will say, "Oh, elbows swinging high, "or not gripping racket "in
appropriate way," et cetera. can see things practitioner can't see.
course vitally important. practitioner also needs use error
recognition signal, need basically focus something errors going
tell focus on. put simply needs period time
just repetition repetition, repetition. think many people including coaches
afraid bad habits will get ingrained. indeed possible,
important errors occur order cue attentional systems open
door plasticity. told, "Look, standing little wide, "I need tighten
stance little bit." Great, need generate many repetitions tighten
stance. constantly cued outside incorrectly,
not going efficient. people, learning sessions might 10

get little bit better perform correctly three times 1000. sounds like
something might probably generous myself. finished

someone will come put comment section YouTube,

focused phones focused learning something else, focusing
performance, not going serve us well, least not going serve
skill learning well. please, interested rapid skill learning try
introducing sessions, can quite powerful. subsequent

although two sessions day going lot people, unless

00:56:59 Pay Attention Striving Improve

high-level athlete, subsequent sessions get express gains
previous session, get perform well, presumably often even
just subtle. Sometimes there'll decrease performance, often
going perform better subsequent subsequent training sessions.
opportunity devote attention specific ways, not just let errors inform
place attention, rather direct perception particular elements
movement order accelerate learning further. clear, 'cause
know many interested concrete protocols. not just
let errors cue attention first session. might one session five
sessions, going depend. familiar something
performing well every while, accomplishing better every
while, can start cue attention deliberate ways. question
therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years
ago. actually several papers now focused this. One
published 2018. Claudia Lappe colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. done
really nice work, talks influence pitch feedback learning
motor timing sequencing. done piano carries athletic
performance well. going describe study you, describe it,
interesting study want know turns
doesn't matter much pay attention learning sequence provided
something related motor behavior performing. seems
incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion



01:11:06 Move Intermediate Advanced Skill Execution faster:

tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.

talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line

attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side

range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways

earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

not mean just increasing dopamine levels learning will allow
learn faster. fact, increasing dopamine levels learning using
pharmacology will actually reduce called signal noise. will make
increases dopamine pop brain suddenly make realize, "Oh,
got one right." will make smaller relative background levels
dopamine. want big spike dopamine perform motor pattern
correctly want make lots errors, many, many repetitions errors order
get correct performance. Now, like people going
way somewhat random. Meaning say tennis serve. can't play
tennis, think probably played tennis twice. throw ball air hit
it, going get wrong probably hit net, hit net. probably
go long probably go fence. point, like think get
correct. dopamine signal going quite big think, "Okay,
there? "I actually don't know, wasn't paying attention. "What paying
attention whether not "the ball went correct location "on opposite side
net." Remember open loop move, don't actually know
correctly. nervous system will take care provided case complete
repetitions. Now, just elevate basil level
dopamine taking, don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine something,
bad increase dopamine actually much lower. say
delta smaller. signal noise smaller overall levels dopamine very,
high.

00:44:40 Framing Effect (& Protocol Defined)

actually going learn less well. skill learning, motor skill learning,
increasing dopamine levels prior not good idea. might help motivation
get learning not going improve plasticity process likely
hinder it. important. errors cue brain something
wrong open possibility plasticity. sometimes called
framing effect, frames important. think shift heard
about, growth mindset incredible discovery theory practice

approach learning sessions. will talk things one can do,
making errors key. isn't motivational speech. not saying, "Oh, go make
errors, "errors good you. "You fail order win." No, fail

session. failures will cue attention

00:46:10 Note & Warning Coaches

appropriate sensory events. Now, sometimes working coach.
shout coaches, thank do. However,
needs least scientific literature say. needs period
training session whereby athlete person kind can simply pay attention
errors without attention cued something else. really well-trained
coach will say, "Oh, elbows swinging high, "or not gripping racket "in
appropriate way," et cetera. can see things practitioner can't see.
course vitally important. practitioner also needs use error
recognition signal, need basically focus something errors going
tell focus on. put simply needs period time
just repetition repetition, repetition. think many people including coaches
afraid bad habits will get ingrained. indeed possible,
important errors occur order cue attentional systems open
door plasticity. told, "Look, standing little wide, "I need tighten
stance little bit." Great, need generate many repetitions tighten
stance. constantly cued outside incorrectly,
not going efficient. people, learning sessions might 10
minutes, people, might hour. Whatever can allocate

want get maximum number repetitions want make errors.
allowing plasticity. science points fact particular

session, need something specific nothing. right.
beautiful data describing neurons hippocampus, area brain involved
consolidation new memories. data points fact sleep,
replay sequence neurons involved certain behaviors previous
day sometimes previous day that. However, also data
show skill learning session, kind motor movement provided not
bringing lot additional new sensory stimuli, replay motor
sequence performed correctly elimination motor
sequences performed incorrectly run backward time.
clear this, learn new skill navigate new city just stay
motor skill, say free-throw golf swing tennis serve, dance
move, novice. still going make lot errors, don't get perfectly, maybe
get little bit better perform correctly three times 1000. sounds like
something might probably generous myself. finished
training session, nothing, not focused additional learning. not
bringing lot sensory information in. just sit close eyes five 10
minutes, even one minute, brain starts replay motor sequence corresponding
correct pattern movement, plays sequence backward. Now plays
backward, don't know. wait sleep regardless sleep
later night, sequence will replayed forwards proper sequence.
Immediately afterward played backward reasons still unclear.
replay sequence backwards appears important consolidation
skill learning. Now, important many people finishing jujitsu class
finishing yoga class finishing dance class
finishing skill learning immediately devoting attention
something else. hear lot visualization going talk


visualization. kind obsession idea can learn things, just
sitting eyes closed without perform movement,
overlooked something perhaps even important least equally important,
skill learning, putting effort something, sitting quietly eyes

skill learning well. please, interested rapid skill learning try
introducing sessions, can quite powerful. subsequent

although two sessions day going lot people, unless
professional



00:56:59 Pay Attention Striving Improve

high-level athlete, subsequent sessions get express gains
previous session, get perform well, presumably often even
just subtle. Sometimes there'll decrease performance, often
going perform better subsequent subsequent training sessions.
opportunity devote attention specific ways, not just let errors inform
place attention, rather direct perception particular elements
movement order accelerate learning further. clear, 'cause
know many interested concrete protocols. not just
let errors cue attention first session. might one session five
sessions, going depend. familiar something
performing well every while, accomplishing better every
while, can start cue attention deliberate ways. question
therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years
ago. actually several papers now focused this. One
published 2018. Claudia Lappe colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. done
really nice work, talks influence pitch feedback learning
motor timing sequencing. done piano carries athletic
performance well. going describe study you, describe it,
interesting study want know turns
doesn't matter much pay attention learning sequence provided
something related motor behavior performing. seems
incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion



01:11:06 Move Intermediate Advanced Skill Execution faster:
Metronomes

nailed every time, problem no ball. already
fair degree proficiency, skill given practice sport instrument.
sort advanced intermediate advanced levels proficiency something,
practice can find interesting data literature, involves
metronoming. realize relates generating repetitions relates
tone experiment doesn't really matter attention cued long
performing many many reps motor sequence. can use metronome
obviously musicians this, athletes can too. can use metronome
set cadence repetitions. Now swimmers, actually device.
able find online, forgot brand name not about,
actually goes swim cap can cue need perform
another stroke. runners, metronome type devices
headphones tone room running indoors treadmill
cue basically need lift heels. that,
athletes find can perform repetitions, can generate output,
can increase speed. number really interesting things done auditory
metronoming. involved little bit work now hopefully able
report back using stroboscopic metronoming. actually changing
speed visual environment. fun experiments, basically changing one's
perception fast moving space playing visual system,
something future discussion. can start use auditory metronoming
generating movements per unit time generating errors therefore
successes neuroplasticity. number different apps
there. found several free apps can set metronome pace, might
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.
know world championship cup stacking. young lady saw
take cups spread table basically just stack


perfect pyramid least amount times kids go wild. something
never thought pursue frankly never will pursue unless life depends
reason, really impressive. look sequence 'cause
recorded, can look YouTube. find
expert cup stackers, just error elimination. two metronomic
auditory cues can actually cue pick cups faster ordinarily
learn that. can anything. think cup stacking probably not
skill interested doing, skill, figure rate
performing repetitions per unit time want increase slightly,
set metronome slightly faster current rate just start
generating repetitions. Now interesting cool relates
back experiment Lappe colleagues, attention now
harnessed tone, metronome, not necessarily terms
motor movement. really need bit proficiency. Again,
people intermediate advanced intermediate advanced.
essentially creating outside pressure, contingency
generate, again, errors. errors get. Now, aren't
errors cups tumble stop can't keep up,
set pace just little bit beyond currently can do. that,
essentially forcing nervous system make errors correct errors
inside session. find really interesting means is,
got sensory perception, paying attention to, proprioception limbs
motor neurons upper lower motor neurons central pattern
generators. can't pay attention to, "Well, upper motor neurons,
"they're lower motor neurons." Forget that, not going that. can't pay
attention proprioception much. super slow motion
proprioception. harness attention something.
harness attention outside contingency, metronome firing off
saying, now go, now go, now go. Not can increase number repetitions,

01:16:44 Increasing Speed Even Means Errors: Training Central Pattern

can use musical metronome. metronomes powerful tool well

generate strokes efficient strokes steps, et cetera. rate
metronome obviously going important. Sometimes trying lengthen
stride, sometimes trying take fewer strokes glide pool
instance. value occasionally just number repetitions, number

generators operate higher speed. One sports kind interesting
speed walking. not one engage ever planned engage in,
ever tried really speed walk, actually difficult walk fast without breaking

horses like trot, gallop on, next thing. Clearly,
don't know anything horses except beautiful liked
much. break different kind stride. shift
different central pattern generators. walking horse moving
slowly breaks jog full sprint gallop horse,
actually engaging different central pattern generators. central pattern
generators always range speeds happiest function at.
metronoming speed purposes, can basically bring activity

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual
Training)

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days
per week 12 weeks considerable. think people, given fact actual
practice, physical practice going lead larger improvements, greater
improvements mental training opt actual physical training.
course, plane don't access guitar
certainly not going sprinting aisle serious
craft want accelerate performance craft strength increases
something sort, augmenting adding visualization training likely
will compound effects actual physical training. not lot studies
looking visualization top pure physical training can increase rates
learning consolidation learning, et cetera. actually hard study
hard control place. probably add
actual physical training always going lead greater effects.

01:35:34 Imagining Something Different Actually Experiencing

point want use visualization training, great, forget idea
visualization training good actual behavior. hear time. People
say, know imagine experience brain body,
exactly actual experience. Absolutely not. not way


nervous system works. sorry, don't mean burst anybody's bubble,
bubble made myths. fact matter brain, executes
movement generating proprioceptive feedback. proprioceptive feedback
critically involved generating sense experience things like learning.
don't say don't like idea visualization couldn't work. fact
visualization work, doesn't work well, doesn't create millu,
chemical millu, environment actual, physically engaging

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version

eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason

well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory

stretching more. can right now. driving, don't

learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students

talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability

people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training

bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,

never great done alone compared actual physical execution

surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason

something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing

beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention

making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

metronome obviously going important. Sometimes trying lengthen
stride, sometimes trying take fewer strokes glide pool
instance. value occasionally just number repetitions, number

generators operate higher speed. One sports kind interesting
speed walking. not one engage ever planned engage in,
ever tried really speed walk, actually difficult walk fast without breaking
run. animals kinds crossover points go. think
horses like trot, gallop on, next thing. Clearly,
don't know anything horses except beautiful liked
much. break different kind stride. shift
different central pattern generators. walking horse moving
slowly breaks jog full sprint gallop horse,
actually engaging different central pattern generators. central pattern
generators always range speeds happiest function at.
metronoming speed purposes, can basically bring activity

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head

attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side

range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways

earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences
keys played piano. work published just couple years

published 2018. Claudia Lappe colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. done
really nice work, talks influence pitch feedback learning

incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention

making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

actually goes swim cap can cue need perform
another stroke. runners, metronome type devices
headphones tone room running indoors treadmill
cue basically need lift heels. that,
athletes find can perform repetitions, can generate output,
can increase speed. number really interesting things done auditory
metronoming. involved little bit work now hopefully able
report back using stroboscopic metronoming. actually changing
speed visual environment. fun experiments, basically changing one's
perception fast moving space playing visual system,
something future discussion. can start use auditory metronoming
generating movements per unit time generating errors therefore
successes neuroplasticity. number different apps
there. found several free apps can set metronome pace, might
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.
know world championship cup stacking. young lady saw
take cups spread table basically just stack


perfect pyramid least amount times kids go wild. something
never thought pursue frankly never will pursue unless life depends
reason, really impressive. look sequence 'cause
recorded, can look YouTube. find
expert cup stackers, just error elimination. two metronomic
auditory cues can actually cue pick cups faster ordinarily
learn that. can anything. think cup stacking probably not
skill interested doing, skill, figure rate
performing repetitions per unit time want increase slightly,
set metronome slightly faster current rate just start
generating repetitions. Now interesting cool relates

motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far

move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't

words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students

that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded

talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability

people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting

bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain

essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

performing well every while, accomplishing better every

therefore becomes cue attention to. good news doesn't matter.
beautiful set experiments done looking sequences

incredible. not good tennis serve. done say thousand repetitions
tennis serve. Maybe got right three 10 times. Now even
generous myself. post-training session let brain idle
get good sleep come back now start generating errors again,
presumably hopefully fewer errors, decide going cue attention
something specific, like maybe tightly holding racket maybe
stance, maybe whether not rotate right shoulder hit ball across.
making up, don't play tennis. Turns long
thing throughout session, learning accelerated. explain


make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason

brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't

take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump

two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line

always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older

30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

make sense moment. just really clear, can one use
powers attention direct attention particular aspects motor movement
familiar general theme movement. pay attention
exactly not important. important pay attention one specific
thing. Claudia Lappe colleagues showed people trying
learn sequence keys piano, multiple forms feedback.
error signals instance, hear piece music told press
keys particular sequence noise comes out, sound comes
piano not sound like song just heard. instead of, here, forgive
neither musical, can sing. instead dah, dah dah, dah,
hear that, dah, dah dah, dah instead play. me, sounds
something like, dah, dah dah [indistinct], wouldn't sound right. wouldn't sound right,
likely got sequence wrong, pressing hard keys
lightly keys, et cetera. showed just instruct people
correct sequence press keys, actually doesn't matter sound comes
back, provided correct sound sound. right,
experiment. people press keys typical piano
generated particular sequence sounds generated pressing
keys piano. modified keyboard case piano
people pressed keys, random tone different tones played time
pressed keys. sounded crazy, sounded like noise, motor sequence
same. single tone played every time pressed key
job task subject just oppressed keys proper
sequence. instead dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
dunt. Instead dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. even hard
say even tone, get idea. singular tone, just think
doorbell rung press key will really annoying. turns
rate motor learning same, whether not getting feedback
accurate keys piano whether not constant tone.
Performance terrible rates learning terrible getting
random tones back. means learning play piano least
early stages really just generating motor commands. not
paying attention sound coming piano. makes sense
beginners, trying focus attention things


can control. think this, conceptualize this, pressing keys
piano paying attention sounds coming two things.
means get deeper deeper practice, focusing purely
motor execution can beneficial. Now, going harder open
loop type things getting feedback. guess good example open loop
attempt back flip. get wrong, will immediately know,
get right, immediately know. Please don't go try back flip
solid ground, even trampoline don't know
likely get wrong get injured. something closed loop
can repeat again, again, advantageous
can perform many many repetitions can start focus learn
focus attention just pattern movement. words, can learn
play piano just fast maybe even faster just focusing sequence
moving digits, fingers not feedback. Now, sure
music teachers piano teachers screaming, "No going ruin
practice "that us embedded minds "and students."
agree, point need start including feedback whether not things
sound correct. one beauties skill learning can choose
parameterize it, meaning can choose just focus motor sequence just
focus sounds coming back integrate those. hear lot
chunking, breaking things component parts.

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual
Training)

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days
per week 12 weeks considerable. think people, given fact actual
practice, physical practice going lead larger improvements, greater
improvements mental training opt actual physical training.
course, plane don't access guitar
certainly not going sprinting aisle serious
craft want accelerate performance craft strength increases
something sort, augmenting adding visualization training likely
will compound effects actual physical training. not lot studies
looking visualization top pure physical training can increase rates
learning consolidation learning, et cetera. actually hard study
hard control place. probably add
actual physical training always going lead greater effects.

01:35:34 Imagining Something Different Actually Experiencing

point want use visualization training, great, forget idea
visualization training good actual behavior. hear time. People
say, know imagine experience brain body,
exactly actual experience. Absolutely not. not way


nervous system works. sorry, don't mean burst anybody's bubble,
bubble made myths. fact matter brain, executes

critically involved generating sense experience things like learning.
don't say don't like idea visualization couldn't work. fact
visualization work, doesn't work well, doesn't create millu,
chemical millu, environment actual, physically engaging

01:37:58 Cadence Training & Learning “Carryover”

just not great 53% increases come actual physical training.

especially older population. remiss didn't least mention them.
going mention one today fact. one particularly interesting
really lot data alpha GPC going attempt pronounce
alpha GPC actually is. alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine. Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. See, keep repetitions, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. made error. Okay, point alpha GPC,

Notable, meaning several studies showed significant modest effect offsetting
cognitive decline, particular older populations populations, even
reported neuro degeneration. Power output notable. notable,
mean, notable? study noted 14% increase power output. pretty
substantial, 14%. think it, wasn't like doubling something
sort. Believe not, symptoms Alzheimer's shown least

training, presumably throughout, afterward thinking following
protocols discussed today, use sort idle time
brain can replay motor sequences reverse. course,
want things optimize sleep. lot questions get
different protocols things described start collide one another.
say instance, go bed 10:30 going skill training 9:30,
well, taking lot caffeine not going good idea 'cause going
compromise sleep. not design perfect schedule
everyone's situation's vary. things optimize repetitions, failures,
repetitions, failures offset training. idle time can
straight sleep simply letting brain just go idle five 10 minutes,
mean not focusing anything, not scrolling, social media, not emailing, not ideally not
even talking somebody just lying sitting quietly eyes closed letting
motor sequences replay. talked one can come back
additional training sessions, use things like metronoming queuing

01:04:45 Protocol Synthesis Part One

one biggest challenges skill learning knowing place
attention. dial again, building protocol across episode, early
sessions, maybe first one, maybe first 10, maybe first 100.
depends many repetitions packing in. initial sessions,
key make many errors let reward process govern plasticity, let errors
open plasticity. learning sessions, let brain go idle least
short period time course, maximize sleep. start incorporating
sessions, start gain skill level, learning harness focus
attention particular features movement independent rewards
feedback. reward no longer tone coming piano whether not


struck target correctly simply motor movement focusing your,
instance dart throw, action arm. embedding plasticity
motor pattern deeply, shown scientific literature. sure
coaches teachers will entirely disagree
great. Please let know prefer, let know think wrong
rarely happens, let know think might right well.
breaking learning process component parts. get
skilled, meaning make fewer fewer errors per given session per unit
time, attention can start migrate one feature motor
sequence another feature perhaps one's stance another sequence,
component sequence, result one getting trial trial
basis. changing time. maybe served tennis ball focusing
ball lands focusing speed, focusing
grip, focusing stance trial trial. mastered core
motor movements done session session, least according
literature access here, seems suboptimal. hopefully starting
make sense, connections upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons central pattern generators, can't attack once.

01:07:10 Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Useful Proficiency
Attained

can't try change once. breaking
things component parts. may wondering speed
movement. data, meaning decent papers showing
ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.
window plasticity never swung open, speak. brings us back
theme errors allow plasticity, correct performance movements semi correct
performance movements, cues synapses brain areas spinal circuits
need change. changes occur period immediately skill
learning sleep. super slow movements can beneficial already
proficiencies. might standing living room just ultra
slow motion, performing tennis serve, learning to, thinking
adjusting elbow arm trajectory exactly taught
tennis coach. trying learn way outset not appear
best way learn skill. start introduce slow learning? Well,
obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 30% success
rate. tried this, actually, struggle basketball whatever reason
free throw terrible. practiced free throws super slow motion

motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far

brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning

can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close

always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days

practice, physical practice going lead larger improvements, greater
improvements mental training opt actual physical training.
course, plane don't access guitar
certainly not going sprinting aisle serious
craft want accelerate performance craft strength increases
something sort, augmenting adding visualization training likely
will compound effects actual physical training. not lot studies
looking visualization top pure physical training can increase rates

well, taking lot caffeine not going good idea 'cause going
compromise sleep. not design perfect schedule
everyone's situation's vary. things optimize repetitions, failures,
repetitions, failures offset training. idle time can
straight sleep simply letting brain just go idle five 10 minutes,
mean not focusing anything, not scrolling, social media, not emailing, not ideally not
even talking somebody just lying sitting quietly eyes closed letting

ultra slow movements, performing movement essentially slow motion can
beneficial enhancing rate skill learning. However, least read
literature, appears ultra slow movements performed degree
proficiency already gained particular movement. Now not
way thought it. thought, well, learning
proper kick paunch martial arts something ultra slow movements
first going way one can best learn perform movement
just gradually increase speed. turns not case probably
known that. probably know turns


ultra slow movements, two things aren't available you. One
proprioceptive feedback not accurate fast movements limbs
different slow movements limbs. don't get opportunity build
proprioceptive feedback. reason doesn't work
accurate, don't generate errors. data able find show
slow movements can beneficial one already proficient practice,
slow movements beginning don't allow learn quickly
never generate errors therefore brain doesn't, not open change.

obviously talk coaches this, recreationally
don't coach, realize many don't. don't coach anything
do. going just navigating using scientific literature. appears
hitting success rates 25 30%, super slow
movements can start beneficial. still performing things rate five
10% correct rest errors, super slow movements probably not
going benefit much. Also super slow movements not really applicable
lot things. instance, imagine throwing dart super slow motion,
actually try throw actual dart, dart's just going fall floor,
obviously. number things like baseball bat swing can
practice super slow motion. try actual baseball
softball something like that, not going give kind feedback
effective was. super slow movements decelerated movement place

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's

skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:11:06 Move Intermediate Advanced Skill Execution faster:
Metronomes

nailed every time, problem no ball. already
fair degree proficiency, skill given practice sport instrument.
sort advanced intermediate advanced levels proficiency something,
practice can find interesting data literature, involves
metronoming. realize relates generating repetitions relates
tone experiment doesn't really matter attention cued long
performing many many reps motor sequence. can use metronome
obviously musicians this, athletes can too. can use metronome
set cadence repetitions. Now swimmers, actually device.
able find online, forgot brand name not about,
actually goes swim cap can cue need perform
another stroke. runners, metronome type devices
headphones tone room running indoors treadmill
cue basically need lift heels. that,
athletes find can perform repetitions, can generate output,
can increase speed. number really interesting things done auditory
metronoming. involved little bit work now hopefully able
report back using stroboscopic metronoming. actually changing
speed visual environment. fun experiments, basically changing one's
perception fast moving space playing visual system,
something future discussion. can start use auditory metronoming
generating movements per unit time generating errors therefore
successes neuroplasticity. number different apps
there. found several free apps can set metronome pace, might
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. little fast things, can imagine
darts golf swings might tick, tick, tick, tick something
like tick, tick. every time metronome goes, swing. Every time
metronome goes, throw dart. Actually wild experiments there.

perfect pyramid least amount times kids go wild. something
never thought pursue frankly never will pursue unless life depends
reason, really impressive. look sequence 'cause

speed walking. not one engage ever planned engage in,
ever tried really speed walk, actually difficult walk fast without breaking
run. animals kinds crossover points go. think
horses like trot, gallop on, next thing. Clearly,
don't know anything horses except beautiful liked
much. break different kind stride. shift
different central pattern generators. walking horse moving
slowly breaks jog full sprint gallop horse,
actually engaging different central pattern generators. central pattern

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual
Training)

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days
per week 12 weeks considerable. think people, given fact actual
practice, physical practice going lead larger improvements, greater
improvements mental training opt actual physical training.
course, plane don't access guitar
certainly not going sprinting aisle serious
craft want accelerate performance craft strength increases
something sort, augmenting adding visualization training likely
will compound effects actual physical training. not lot studies
looking visualization top pure physical training can increase rates
learning consolidation learning, et cetera. actually hard study
hard control place. probably add
actual physical training always going lead greater effects.

01:35:34 Imagining Something Different Actually Experiencing

point want use visualization training, great, forget idea
visualization training good actual behavior. hear time. People
say, know imagine experience brain body,
exactly actual experience. Absolutely not. not way


nervous system works. sorry, don't mean burst anybody's bubble,
bubble made myths. fact matter brain, executes
movement generating proprioceptive feedback. proprioceptive feedback
critically involved generating sense experience things like learning.
don't say don't like idea visualization couldn't work. fact
visualization work, doesn't work well, doesn't create millu,
chemical millu, environment actual, physically engaging
behavior, skill resistance training, et cetera. willing wager
true experiences kinds. PTSD incredibly unfortunate
circumstance replay often traumatic event feels real.
not say replay actual event. course,
PTSD needs dealt utmost level seriousness, treated.
fact, lab works sorts things, point visualization
imagining something not actual experience grounded
idea proprioception. fact feedback cerebellum, cerebellum,
talking areas brain critically involved communicating rest
nervous system. not just believe something happening something
actually happening. case muscle loads, muscles actually feeling tension,
actual feeling tension muscle. contracting muscle
tension part important adaptation process. future episode, talk
hypertrophy works level upper motor neurons, lower motor
neurons muscle itself. now just know visualization can work. doesn't
work well real physical training practice, effects 35% 13.5%
increases pretty considerable.

01:37:58 Cadence Training & Learning “Carryover”

just not great 53% increases come actual physical training.
interested skill learning relates
musical training, also cadence metronomes tones, et cetera, can
support physical learning. interested that, fussy autos,
wonderful review, also published Journal Neuron again, excellent journal
Herholz Zatorre, H-E-R-H-O-L-Z Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E. really
describes detail musical training can impact sorts different things


cadence training, whether not tones auditory feedback things sort

01:39:00 Ingestible Compounds Support Skill Learning: Motivation, Repetitions,
Alpha-GPC

available complete article free charge, et cetera. Many probably
asking can take order accelerate skill learning? Well, conditions
going vary, motivation key. show training session
motivated enough focus attention perform lot repetitions
training sequence. just prerequisite. no pill going allow
fewer repetitions extract learning fewer repetitions. actually
question conditions can create can
generate repetitions per unit time. think right way think it.
conditions can create mind body
going allow focus? talked focus plasticity motivation
previous episodes. Please see episodes questions that.
detailed lot tools underlying science. people, might drinking
cup coffee getting hydrated training session. you,
might avoiding coffee makes jittery attention jumps
place. going vary tremendously. no magic pill going
allow get less, just not going happen. simply not going
happen. not going get learning fewer repetitions less time.
However, compounds think worth mentioning
ability improve actual physical performance, actual execution certain types
movements. also shown improve cognitive function,
especially older population. remiss didn't least mention them.
going mention one today fact. one particularly interesting
really lot data alpha GPC going attempt pronounce
alpha GPC actually is. alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine. Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. See, keep repetitions, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. made error. Okay, point alpha GPC,


least United States sold counter typically taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams. single dose shown
number things might beneficial. One enhance power
output. engaging something like Shotput throwing resistance training
sprinting something generate lot power, maybe
rock climbing, working particular aspect rock climbing
involves generating lot force, lot power. Well theory, alpha GPC
beneficial you. cognitive effects, dosages much higher 1200
milligrams daily divided three doses 400 milligrams studies
able find show used. effects cognitive decline described notable.
Notable, meaning several studies showed significant modest effect offsetting
cognitive decline, particular older populations populations, even
reported neuro degeneration. Power output notable. notable,
mean, notable? study noted 14% increase power output. pretty
substantial, 14%. think it, wasn't like doubling something
sort. Believe not, symptoms Alzheimer's shown least
among nutraceuticals alpha GPC significantly improve cognition
people Alzheimer's. Now episode, isn't cognitive decline longevity,
will talk that, so-called another effect alpha GPC. Fat oxidation
increased alpha GPC, growth hormone release promoted alpha GPC
although small degree. can see, things like alpha GPC particular
combined low levels caffeine can effects improving power
output, can improve growth hormone release, can improve fat oxidation. things
theory can support skill learning. really adjusting
foundation upon going execute many, many repetitions.
thing said caffeine itself. something motivates
gets chair actually physical training, something can
perhaps improve enhance rate skill learning

01:43:39 Summary & Sequencing Tools: Reps, Fails, Idle Time, Sleep, Metronome,
Visualization

well retain skills. Now previous episode talked about,
episode epinephrin adrenaline. talked mental, cognitive


learning, makes sense spike epinephrin, bump epinephrin levels adrenaline
levels cognitive learning. physical learning, appears opposite
caffeine practice decide try alpha GPC want
training, take training use it. effect extend
training, presumably throughout, afterward thinking following
protocols discussed today, use sort idle time
brain can replay motor sequences reverse. course,
want things optimize sleep. lot questions get
different protocols things described start collide one another.
say instance, go bed 10:30 going skill training 9:30,
well, taking lot caffeine not going good idea 'cause going
compromise sleep. not design perfect schedule
everyone's situation's vary. things optimize repetitions, failures,
repetitions, failures offset training. idle time can
straight sleep simply letting brain just go idle five 10 minutes,
mean not focusing anything, not scrolling, social media, not emailing, not ideally not
even talking somebody just lying sitting quietly eyes closed letting
motor sequences replay. talked one can come back
additional training sessions, use things like metronoming queuing
attention external cue, stimulus, case, auditory stimulus
likely trying generate repetitions per unit time. again, repetitions
errors, key. also talked things can involving
cerebellar neurophysiology extend range motion limiting
use visualization augment practice say particular skill involves nice
weather raining snowing outside can't get outside thunderstorm,
visualization training might good replacement
conditions. cases going kind thing going want
addition actual physical skill strength training session done, least
study described

go throughout sleep wakefulness optimal learning attention.
waking state, stages sleep either predominantly
slowey sleep rem sleep. following podcast
might asking, well physical practice 90 minutes. going

might long. not going able generate enough force output
worthwhile. golfing, don't know. never played golf friends
play golf, disappear onto golf course many hours. know lot
walking driving stuff, even hear somebody carries stuff around
sometimes, not always. going differ. four hour golf game,
probably not swinging golf club four hours, going depend. say
ultradian cycle not necessarily good constraint skill learning
cases. say short time limited
amounts time, 10 minutes maximum repetitions, maximum focus skill learning work
going beneficial. Whereas two hours kind haphazard not really focused
work not generating many repetitions 'cause
repetitions texting phone pay attention something else,
not going beneficial. really density training inside session.
think let the... Work toward maximal near maximum density repetitions
failures provided failures can perform safely order accelerate skill
learning don't let arbitrary case, ultradian constraint prevent
engaging practice. words, get work in, get much work done

mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason

go throughout sleep wakefulness optimal learning attention.
waking state, stages sleep either predominantly
slowey sleep rem sleep. following podcast
might asking, well physical practice 90 minutes. going
depend physical practices, oftentimes instance, strength training,
might long. not going able generate enough force output
worthwhile. golfing, don't know. never played golf friends
play golf, disappear onto golf course many hours. know lot
walking driving stuff, even hear somebody carries stuff around
sometimes, not always. going differ. four hour golf game,
probably not swinging golf club four hours, going depend. say
ultradian cycle not necessarily good constraint skill learning
cases. say short time limited
amounts time, 10 minutes maximum repetitions, maximum focus skill learning work
going beneficial. Whereas two hours kind haphazard not really focused
work not generating many repetitions 'cause
repetitions texting phone pay attention something else,
not going beneficial. really density training inside session.
think let the... Work toward maximal near maximum density repetitions
failures provided failures can perform safely order accelerate skill
learning don't let arbitrary case, ultradian constraint prevent

external,

01:19:12 Integrated Learning: Leveraging Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)

can internal ultimately skill learning brought together.
talk skill learning occurs nervous system. going
give really, think really cool tool can increase flexibility range
motion based particular brain area. tool used first heard
about, not believe work. not hack, actually anchored deeply
biology particular brain region whose meaning mini brain.
mini brain called cerebellum. cerebellum called
mini brain back brain. looks like little mini version
rest brain. absolutely incredible structure involved movement.
also lot non-movement associated functions. brief, cerebellum gets input
senses, particularly, eyes pays attention eyes
space, looking at. basically takes information three aspects
eyes eye movements occurring head goes like this,
called pitch. pitch. listening just nodding
yaw, like shaking head, no, side side.
roll, like sometimes see primate, like Marmoset
something, will roll head look you. Actually, reason
helps generate depth perception, kind form motion parallax
curious that. not look cute, that, even
stationary stationary, get better depth perception far
away are. got pitch, yaw roll. move head
move body move space, image retina
moves, pitch, yaw roll combination, information relayed
cerebellum. rich visual information. also map body surface
movements timing cerebellum. incredible structure
brings together timing movements, limbs moving proprioceptive
information. really mini brain, just coolest little structure back there.


humans, actually not little, just incredible structure. Now,
information integrated there, people don't tell us lot learning
motor sequences skill learning involves timing occurs cerebellum. Now,
can't really use information except know learn something pretty
well,

01:22:02 Protocol Increasing Limb Range Motion, Immediately

handed off kind handled cerebellum, something can
cerebellum increase range motion flexibility. Much flexibility,
believe not not tendons particular length elasticity, although
plays role, not muscles short. don't know
even mean. people longer muscle bellies shorter muscle bellies,
muscles always essentially span entire length bone limb close
it, along tendons. neural innervation muscle
fact muscles elongated, point won't stretch
longer nerves fire, shut actually inhibitory
pathways prevent contracting muscles extending them,
stretching more. can right now. driving, don't
unless self-driving car, need take hands off
steering. way vision muscles represented
cerebellum, turns range visual motion range vision, literally
wide field view take impacts far can extend limbs.
talk second exactly explore this. move
space, walk forward walk backward, tilt head
learn skill, just operate normal ways throughout day, driving, biking,
et cetera, eyes generating spontaneous movements offset visual slip.
words, don't see world blurry even though moving
eyes generating low compensatory eye movements offset motion.
spin, experiment. fun experiment medical students
spin around chair eyes closed stop
open eyes eyes going like this, nystagmus. don't
suggest experiment. kids, different experiment
take stick look top stick spin around


lawn looking top stick put ground try jump
it. ended like jumping side, miss thing entirely. reason
two "experiments" hope don't somebody else do.
reason work normally eye movements balance
limb movements coordinated. spin around looking stick,
fixating eyes one location moving.
stop two mechanisms completely uncoupled like
thrown outer space. never outer space, probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity. spin around chair eyes closed,
not giving visual input spinning. open eyes
eyes call vestibular, eyes jolting back forth,
back forth. Again, aren't experiments need 'cause just told
result. However, want extend range motion, can by...
things always look goofy, point just kind used things.
want extend range movement, first, want measure range motion.
listening stretching arms like T either side
trying push far back can, feels like line
shoulders can't get much further. not really super flexible particularly
inflexible least physically. stop. move eyes
far periphery. moving eyes way left keeping head
body stationary. trying look left shoulder far can off
right. little awkward this, mostly going just focus
left right. Now sending signal cerebellum
field view way way there. Remember visual
attention aperture. can narrow, can broad. talked
benefits taking broad visual aperture order relax nervous
system. just moving eyes, not head, like just second, side
side. Now can retest. actually get five 15 degree increase
range motion. Now you. can say, "Well, gamed 'cause
knew "the result hoping for." can try this. can
legs too. can limb essentially. purely cerebellar.
proprioceptive visual limb movement feedback converge ways
control muscle spindles way control muscle fibers
tendons essentially can get bigger range motion. actually warm


exercise skill learning movements body also
moving eyes side side order generate larger range motion range
motion something interested in. fun one can play
little bit purely cerebellar. time get back cerebellar
function. sorts just incredible stuff can cerebellum. talked
earlier episode neuro-plasticity can disrupt vestibular world.
words, getting modes acceleration, moving space
tilted certain ways, can open windows plasticity yet ways.
can check out, one earlier episodes neuroplasticity everything's
timestamped. meanwhile, want expand range motion
skill learning afterward, fun one. also kind neat kind
aversion stretching work. never seems like something want
always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

01:33:50 Results 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual
Training)

visualization powerful tool. can use visualization? Well, study,
people perform five days week. believe 15. Yes, 15
minutes per day, five days week 12 weeks. lot mental rehearsal.
not ton time day, 15 minutes per day. sitting down, closing eyes
imagining going particular skill practice moving weight. Maybe playing
keys piano thing strings guitar, 15 minutes day, five days
per week 12 weeks considerable. think people, given fact actual

available complete article free charge, et cetera. Many probably
asking can take order accelerate skill learning? Well, conditions
going vary, motivation key. show training session
motivated enough focus attention perform lot repetitions
training sequence. just prerequisite. no pill going allow
fewer repetitions extract learning fewer repetitions. actually
question conditions can create can
generate repetitions per unit time. think right way think it.
conditions can create mind body
going allow focus? talked focus plasticity motivation
previous episodes. Please see episodes questions that.
detailed lot tools underlying science. people, might drinking
cup coffee getting hydrated training session. you,
might avoiding coffee makes jittery attention jumps
place. going vary tremendously. no magic pill going
allow get less, just not going happen. simply not going
happen. not going get learning fewer repetitions less time.
However, compounds think worth mentioning
ability improve actual physical performance, actual execution certain types
movements. also shown improve cognitive function,
especially older population. remiss didn't least mention them.
going mention one today fact. one particularly interesting
really lot data alpha GPC going attempt pronounce
alpha GPC actually is. alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine. Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. See, keep repetitions, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. made error. Okay, point alpha GPC,


least United States sold counter typically taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams. single dose shown
number things might beneficial. One enhance power
output. engaging something like Shotput throwing resistance training
sprinting something generate lot power, maybe
rock climbing, working particular aspect rock climbing
involves generating lot force, lot power. Well theory, alpha GPC
beneficial you. cognitive effects, dosages much higher 1200
milligrams daily divided three doses 400 milligrams studies
able find show used. effects cognitive decline described notable.
Notable, meaning several studies showed significant modest effect offsetting
cognitive decline, particular older populations populations, even
reported neuro degeneration. Power output notable. notable,
mean, notable? study noted 14% increase power output. pretty
substantial, 14%. think it, wasn't like doubling something
sort. Believe not, symptoms Alzheimer's shown least
among nutraceuticals alpha GPC significantly improve cognition
people Alzheimer's. Now episode, isn't cognitive decline longevity,
will talk that, so-called another effect alpha GPC. Fat oxidation
increased alpha GPC, growth hormone release promoted alpha GPC
although small degree. can see, things like alpha GPC particular
combined low levels caffeine can effects improving power
output, can improve growth hormone release, can improve fat oxidation. things
theory can support skill learning. really adjusting
foundation upon going execute many, many repetitions.
thing said caffeine itself. something motivates

caffeine practice decide try alpha GPC want
training, take training use it. effect extend
training, presumably throughout, afterward thinking following
protocols discussed today, use sort idle time
brain can replay motor sequences reverse. course,
want things optimize sleep. lot questions get
different protocols things described start collide one another.
say instance, go bed 10:30 going skill training 9:30,
well, taking lot caffeine not going good idea 'cause going
compromise sleep. not design perfect schedule
everyone's situation's vary. things optimize repetitions, failures,
repetitions, failures offset training. idle time can
straight sleep simply letting brain just go idle five 10 minutes,
mean not focusing anything, not scrolling, social media, not emailing, not ideally not
even talking somebody just lying sitting quietly eyes closed letting
motor sequences replay. talked one can come back
additional training sessions, use things like metronoming queuing
attention external cue, stimulus, case, auditory stimulus
likely trying generate repetitions per unit time. again, repetitions
errors, key. also talked things can involving
cerebellar neurophysiology extend range motion limiting
use visualization augment practice say particular skill involves nice
weather raining snowing outside can't get outside thunderstorm,
visualization training might good replacement
conditions. cases going kind thing going want
addition actual physical skill strength training session done, least

always put off. start visual practice expanding field view off
one side side down, find naturally flexible.

01:28:30 Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: Correctly

not naturally flexible. happened expanded range motion.
talk visualization mental rehearsal. asked lot,
think relates back kind matrix Hollywood idea can just embedded
skill. Although case, fairness, visualization involves work.
talked earlier episode people find hard mentally
visualize things. people find easy. great work done
1960s Roger Shepherd Stanford others, looking people's ability
rotate three-dimensional objects mind. people really good
people less good this. one can get better repeating it.
question going deal today help, let learn things faster?
indeed answer appears yes, can. However, despite heard,
not good. not total replacement physical performance itself. going
really concrete this. hear time just imagining contracting
muscle can lead gains actually contracting muscle. Just imagining
skill can lead increases performance actually executing skill.
simply not case. However, can supplement support physical training
skill learning ways quite powerful. One interesting studies


Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.

Rang Ganason all, forgive pronunciation. slightly older
paper, 2004, nonetheless one thought particularly impressive results
included appropriate controls, et cetera. looked
30 subjects. divide different groups. one group perform
essentially finger flection. actually sort imagine just listening this,
come finger movement. also elbow flection, bicep curl type
movement. either subjects actual physical movement
resistance, imagine moving finger wrist towards shoulder, meaning
bending elbow towards actual resistance. Just make long story short,
found increases finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength 35% elbow flection strength
13.5%, pretty impressive considering just done mentally.
people imagine moving weight, heavyweight imagined people
moving wrist towards shoulder heavyweight. again,
weren't it, just imagining it. experiments looked brain
happening brain time. talk moment.
essentially found improvements strength anywhere 13.5
35%. However, actual physical training group, groups actually moved
wrist moved finger actual physical weight improvements
53%. repeats throughout literature mental rehearsal can cause
increases strength. can create increases skill acquisition learning,
never great done alone compared actual physical execution
movements physical movement weights, shouldn't come
surprising. However, step back say, "Well, source
improvement?" might not care source tell one
brain area another brain area. difference make? again, can
understand mechanism little bit, position create newer even better
protocols. mental rehearsal appears engage activity upper
motor neurons talked way back beginning episode.
Remember upper motor neurons control deliberate action, got
lower motor neurons actually connect muscles move muscles
central pattern generators. Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
thinking particular sequence movement visualizing one's "mind's eye"
creates activation upper motor neurons similar not


actual movement. makes sense upper motor neurons
command movement. not ones actually execute movement.
Remember, upper motor neurons ones generate command
movement, not actual movement. ones generate actual movement
lower motor neurons central pattern generators.
