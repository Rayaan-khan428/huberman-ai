further, just want highlight key takeaway previous episode,
episode focus. fact toolkit focus. toolkit focus
episode, talked large number behavioral, pharmacologic, another
interventions can use increase level concentration focus
whatever purpose, cognitive endeavors, learning languages, focusing school, work,
et cetera, physical pursuits. Now one key takeaways really two
key protocols believe everyone understand know
work effective, also dovetail nicely
information going talk today, will explain nicotine
effective increasing focus. two protocols follows. Data based
studies done Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University. course, Wendy
guest podcast. can check episode like, studies done
laboratory point fact daily, brief, fact, 13 minute
meditation can vastly increase focus focus ability, not just immediately
meditation practice, times well. again, meditation practice
done daily just 13 minutes. simple meditation practice one sits
lies down, closes eyes directs attention place just two
eyes right it. forehead. just inside that, please
understand brain not sensory receptors. unlike focusing
fingertips sensations there, focus brain, can't actually sense
anything brain except thoughts. idea continually
bring focus back location just inch behind forehead
again. refocusing attention location drifts
succeeds increasing focus ability, again, not just meditation
afterward, times well. 13 minute day meditation exceedingly
simple exceedingly effective. performed every day, miss
day, just go back it. Don't despair much. will see positive
effects, say data. Also increase effects mood

neurochemistry model dopamine, provides ongoing motivation. pushes
arrow forward continually strive focus particular thing. particular
arrow model, ability increase focus, can enhanced therefore
increasing acetylcholine, epinephrine, dopamine simultaneously. lot
different ways that. one effective ways via supplement
protocols so-called Alpha GPC. Alpha GPC taken 300 milligram form 10 30
minutes cognitive work physical work will increase
focus way increasing acetylcholine, extent, increasing epinephrine
well. dopamine increase will achieved either cognitive
processing, telling good job moving forward
thoughts really impact levels dopamine, sort pro dopamine
dopamine increasing protocol also discussed toolkit focus episode
dopamine motivation drive. key thing understand 13
minute day meditation effective way increase focus capacity.
short term, want provide boost now focus, 300 milligrams
Alpha GPC can effective. various sources link one
show note captions. no means saying need take alpha
GPC. number people will certainly opt not to. number people might
saying, well, heard Alpha GPC can increase focus way increasing


acetylcholine norepinephrine epinephrine, can also increase TMAO,
kind negative marker cardiac health cardiovascular health.
reason, many others will take 600 milligrams garlic capsule, can offset
TMAO increase. remains uncertain much Alpha GPC one needs take
increasing TMAO levels point concern even need
take garlic capsule. just mention case, pretty simple
fix. Garlic health benefits too, course, people, 300 milligrams
Alpha GPC taken every while. certainly don't encourage people take Alpha
GPC every time want focus. always emphasize behavioral tools first,
focusing nutritional tools occasion using supplement based tools
encourage increased levels focus. course various number
different prescription compounds working board certified physician,
prescribe need additional tools focus, things like Ritalin,
Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil, Vyvanse, et cetera, many people going
important maybe even necessary people ADHD, et cetera,
category itself. always say, not physician, don't prescribe
anything. professor, profess many things. today just wanted pass
along redirect attention episode focus highlight two tools,
13 minute day meditation, 300 milligram Alpha GPC increasing focus
capacity acutely, temporarily giving additional boost
focus. course, choose not use protocols, perfectly fine too,
certainly no obligation. simply available choose try
them. nothing else now mind neurochemistry acetylcholine,
epinephrine slash adrenaline, dopamine, will really set stage
understanding just effective nicotine effective increasing focus,

want remind everybody really need separate discussion
nicotine discussion delivery device nicotine. words,
talking nicotine, not necessarily talking smoking. Although
might be. things associated smoking vaping means
getting nicotine system effects, negative,
cases positive. Indeed later, will talk can actually use nicotine get
smoking addiction. won't come surprise many people,
perhaps will come surprise fact many people actually use nicotine-like
substances nicotine order relieve nicotine addiction. talk
looks like offer various protocols later episode. also
want mention outset long standing interest nicotine. fact,
early scientific career, research nicotine role brain development.
long standing interest neuroplasticity, brain's ability change


response experience. experiments done close colleagues
friends mine really emphasized fact acetylcholine, particular,
acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors, something learn
little bit, can actually serve gateway trigger directed rewiring
brain. fascinating. think nicotine something take,
actually receptors locations brain nicotine binds can
exert effects. receptors not come existence
tobacco existence vaping pens, existence anything
outside world. fact nicotinic receptors brain body tells
acetylcholine nicotine important roles normal brain
body function, much often like point anecdote well known
Nobel prize winning neuroscientist. won't reveal are. not faculty

outside world know person. also well known love
nicotine. sat person's office, he, will reveal he, consumed no
fewer three pieces nicotine gum relatively short conversation
45 minutes. surprising me. asked taking much
nicotine nicotine gum. replied years, chronic
smoker, one hand greatly impaired cardiovascular health
fitness, no surprise there. talk little bit underlying
reasons are, everyone, not everyone knows smoking cigarettes
smoking general really impairs lung health. just simply no question it.
less unhealthy ways smoke, quite honest message
smoking kind going disrupt lung endothelial function, lung function, blood
vessels, forth. going make harder breathe vigor, take deep
breaths, deliver oxygen tissues, et cetera. said, also pointed data
nicotine specifically pointing fact nicotine can be, can protective
certain forms cognitive impairment. continued chew
nicotine containing gum. swore focus enhancing motivation

run start chewing consuming nicotine containing products. will talk
products later episode, potential advantages,
potential disadvantages. Now share anecdote nicely separates nicotine
delivery device nicotine arrives. Now haven't talked


individual years see whether not nicotine working stave off kind
Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cognitive impairment come age.
gentleman getting years seems quite sharp nonetheless,
always exceedingly sharp. point nicotine substance can
promote cognitive function, conditions, taken inappropriate,
say extreme dosages, can also impair cognitive function. today really
need nuanced conversation nicotine, one includes
benefits, drawbacks, particular children, certainly people
pregnant, people addictive tendencies, people depression
kind mood disorders. will tell soon nicotine can
powerful mood modulator many people tried quit nicotine
mainly form smoking will find mood can drop substantially.
nicotine lot things brain body.

00:19:55 Nicotine Found? Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

like begin talking exactly nicotine impacts
brain body. nicotine found? Now obviously nicotine
found tobacco plant, nicotine also found nightshades. tomatoes,
eggplant, sweet peppers. Although concentrations nicotine tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers vastly lower tobacco plant. actually
can also find nicotine potatoes. Now nicotine present potatoes tomatoes
tobacco plant all? Well, nicotine plant alkaloid. get alkaloids
little bit later, thought alkaloids evolved plants way prevent
insects eating them. without going lot insect biology, reason
rationale behind explanation nicotine not substance tobacco
people use various medications people use, also used
pesticide can dramatically disrupt nervous system insects. can render
infertile, not say renders humans infertile. want say, again,
not case nicotine renders humans infertile, can make certain insects
infertile. can actually disrupt motor function brain function,
reasons different effects insects, words, can kill
prevent reproducing, therefore explains plants probably evolved
plant alkaloid, nicotine. humans, differences receptors


nicotine, located, types receptors, effects nicotine
humans quite bit different. again, not cause infertility humans.
Although will talk little bit later double blind peer-reviewed studies
conducted humans indicate instance, nicotine can reduce penile girth,
girth penis, can lead certain forms sexual dysfunction.
changes largely downstream changes blood flow endothelial cell function.
Endothelial cells cells make blood vessels vascular type
tissues within brain body. nicotine found plants. can
know sure point human evolution, somebody group
people, either, here, completely guessing, just story, someone
group must inhaled smoke tobacco plant put dried leaves
tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors
acetylcholinergic variety. know lot think lot hear
haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.

ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic

Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Today really simple. Nicotine binds
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bunch different ones bunch
different tissues.

point spinal cord part central nervous system. fairness
reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part

within brain, nicotine binds alpha four beta two receptor various locations

smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social

nicotine nicotine impacts brains, bodies, mental performance,
mental health, physical performance, physical health. Now again,
want remind everybody really need separate discussion
nicotine discussion delivery device nicotine. words,
talking nicotine, not necessarily talking smoking. Although
might be. things associated smoking vaping means
getting nicotine system effects, negative,
cases positive. Indeed later, will talk can actually use nicotine get
smoking addiction. won't come surprise many people,
perhaps will come surprise fact many people actually use nicotine-like
substances nicotine order relieve nicotine addiction. talk
looks like offer various protocols later episode. also
want mention outset long standing interest nicotine. fact,
early scientific career, research nicotine role brain development.
long standing interest neuroplasticity, brain's ability change


response experience. experiments done close colleagues
friends mine really emphasized fact acetylcholine, particular,
acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors, something learn
little bit, can actually serve gateway trigger directed rewiring
brain. fascinating. think nicotine something take,
actually receptors locations brain nicotine binds can
exert effects. receptors not come existence
tobacco existence vaping pens, existence anything
outside world. fact nicotinic receptors brain body tells
acetylcholine nicotine important roles normal brain
body function, much often like point anecdote well known
Nobel prize winning neuroscientist. won't reveal are. not faculty
member Stanford, many neuroscientists know person many people
outside world know person. also well known love
nicotine. sat person's office, he, will reveal he, consumed no
fewer three pieces nicotine gum relatively short conversation
45 minutes. surprising me. asked taking much
nicotine nicotine gum. replied years, chronic
smoker, one hand greatly impaired cardiovascular health
fitness, no surprise there. talk little bit underlying
reasons are, everyone, not everyone knows smoking cigarettes
smoking general really impairs lung health. just simply no question it.
less unhealthy ways smoke, quite honest message
smoking kind going disrupt lung endothelial function, lung function, blood
vessels, forth. going make harder breathe vigor, take deep
breaths, deliver oxygen tissues, et cetera. said, also pointed data
nicotine specifically pointing fact nicotine can be, can protective
certain forms cognitive impairment. continued chew
nicotine containing gum. swore focus enhancing motivation
enhancing effects nicotine containing gum. Now not call arms
run start chewing consuming nicotine containing products. will talk
products later episode, potential advantages,
potential disadvantages. Now share anecdote nicely separates nicotine
delivery device nicotine arrives. Now haven't talked


individual years see whether not nicotine working stave off kind
Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cognitive impairment come age.
gentleman getting years seems quite sharp nonetheless,
always exceedingly sharp. point nicotine substance can
promote cognitive function, conditions, taken inappropriate,
say extreme dosages, can also impair cognitive function. today really
need nuanced conversation nicotine, one includes
benefits, drawbacks, particular children, certainly people
pregnant, people addictive tendencies, people depression
kind mood disorders. will tell soon nicotine can
powerful mood modulator many people tried quit nicotine
mainly form smoking will find mood can drop substantially.
nicotine lot things brain body.

00:19:55 Nicotine Found? Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

like begin talking exactly nicotine impacts
brain body. nicotine found? Now obviously nicotine
found tobacco plant, nicotine also found nightshades. tomatoes,
eggplant, sweet peppers. Although concentrations nicotine tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers vastly lower tobacco plant. actually
can also find nicotine potatoes. Now nicotine present potatoes tomatoes
tobacco plant all? Well, nicotine plant alkaloid. get alkaloids
little bit later, thought alkaloids evolved plants way prevent
insects eating them. without going lot insect biology, reason
rationale behind explanation nicotine not substance tobacco
people use various medications people use, also used
pesticide can dramatically disrupt nervous system insects. can render
infertile, not say renders humans infertile. want say, again,
not case nicotine renders humans infertile, can make certain insects
infertile. can actually disrupt motor function brain function,
reasons different effects insects, words, can kill
prevent reproducing, therefore explains plants probably evolved
plant alkaloid, nicotine. humans, differences receptors


nicotine, located, types receptors, effects nicotine
humans quite bit different. again, not cause infertility humans.
Although will talk little bit later double blind peer-reviewed studies
conducted humans indicate instance, nicotine can reduce penile girth,
girth penis, can lead certain forms sexual dysfunction.
changes largely downstream changes blood flow endothelial cell function.
Endothelial cells cells make blood vessels vascular type
tissues within brain body. nicotine found plants. can
know sure point human evolution, somebody group
people, either, here, completely guessing, just story, someone
group must inhaled smoke tobacco plant put dried leaves
tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors
acetylcholinergic variety. know lot think lot hear
haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.
binds receptors, little parking spots cells, changes way
cells behave. cells can increase activity release chemicals.
can become electrically active, can number different things.


ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic
background just like humans. family acetylcholine receptors
nicotinic variety. maybe one street neighborhood, know
Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Today really simple. Nicotine binds
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bunch different ones bunch
different tissues.

00:25:12 Nicotine & Effects Brain: Appetite, Dopamine & GABA

differences receptors dictate sorts effects nicotine will
tissues. talk effects are, dividing
effects nicotine effects brain, everything neck up,
body, so-called central nervous system periphery. Although want
point spinal cord part central nervous system. fairness
reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part
binding alpha four beta two receptor particular area brain. going
return little bit, ever heard nicotine kills appetite,
indeed does. not behavior smoking itself. not always
cigarette mouth not eating food. Although suppose might
minor effect. direct effects nicotine appetite, is, reduces


appetite direct effects metabolism, is, increases metabolism

within brain, nicotine binds alpha four beta two receptor various locations
brain. three maybe fourth talk neurochemical
effects nicotine ingest it. First things first, ingest nicotine
smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social
media time time, say, wait, didn't mention alpha two beta six
receptor yet. Okay look, get it. splitters room, sake
today's discussion ease digestibility this, just want point
norepinephrine, epinephrine, adrenaline, going treat common pool
similar, fact, similar molecules net effect, least
context discussion increase levels alertness, energy, arousal.
way nicotine accomplishes increases alertness arousal
energy within brain triggering release no epinephrine little cluster

acetylcholine nucleus basalis, causes attentional spotlighting, increases
concentration focus, feel good properties dopamine
motivating properties dopamine released mesolimbic reward pathway. Now
can start get picture nicotine powerful molecule. making
people feel motivated good. making people feel focused makes people
feel alert otherwise feel little bit sleepy. really powerful
compound, fact, going back earlier discussion focus tools

number different tools protocols increase focus.
talking one molecule, nicotine, found plants like tomatoes potatoes
tobacco plant. can synthesized laboratory ingested
patch gum even pill toothpick dipped nicotine. One molecule can
trigger activation circuits focus motivation one fell swoop.
remarkable. absolutely remarkable. haven't even touched
psychological components focus, right? Whether not interested
something, whether not excited not. very, powerful
system. powerful fact, think can really place nicotine right
top, right next caffeine molecule fundamentally changed human
evolution, human consciousness, human experience. Even somebody

external trigger within brain body, say without trigger
nicotine particular binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

00:41:10 Nicotine & Effects Appetite & Metabolism

creating effects brain body, just absolutely staggering. Now
earlier mentioned appetite suppressing indeed metabolism increasing effects
nicotine. fairly niche component nicotine does, mean,
important one, not major reason people consume nicotine. like
take moment talk now, brain talking

talk this. Now can conversation nicotine appetite
metabolism simple straightforward way. like learn

bind what? Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Put plain English, nicotinic receptors
also ways muscles can get activated. therefore,
increasing nicotine cause relaxation muscles?
neural circuits upstream muscles little bit

want remind everybody really need separate discussion
nicotine discussion delivery device nicotine. words,
talking nicotine, not necessarily talking smoking. Although
might be. things associated smoking vaping means
getting nicotine system effects, negative,
cases positive. Indeed later, will talk can actually use nicotine get
smoking addiction. won't come surprise many people,
perhaps will come surprise fact many people actually use nicotine-like
substances nicotine order relieve nicotine addiction. talk
looks like offer various protocols later episode. also
want mention outset long standing interest nicotine. fact,
early scientific career, research nicotine role brain development.
long standing interest neuroplasticity, brain's ability change


response experience. experiments done close colleagues
friends mine really emphasized fact acetylcholine, particular,
acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors, something learn
little bit, can actually serve gateway trigger directed rewiring
brain. fascinating. think nicotine something take,
actually receptors locations brain nicotine binds can
exert effects. receptors not come existence
tobacco existence vaping pens, existence anything
outside world. fact nicotinic receptors brain body tells
acetylcholine nicotine important roles normal brain

45 minutes. surprising me. asked taking much
nicotine nicotine gum. replied years, chronic
smoker, one hand greatly impaired cardiovascular health
fitness, no surprise there. talk little bit underlying
reasons are, everyone, not everyone knows smoking cigarettes
smoking general really impairs lung health. just simply no question it.
less unhealthy ways smoke, quite honest message
smoking kind going disrupt lung endothelial function, lung function, blood
vessels, forth. going make harder breathe vigor, take deep

individual years see whether not nicotine working stave off kind
Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cognitive impairment come age.
gentleman getting years seems quite sharp nonetheless,
always exceedingly sharp. point nicotine substance can
promote cognitive function, conditions, taken inappropriate,
say extreme dosages, can also impair cognitive function. today really
need nuanced conversation nicotine, one includes
benefits, drawbacks, particular children, certainly people
pregnant, people addictive tendencies, people depression
kind mood disorders. will tell soon nicotine can
powerful mood modulator many people tried quit nicotine
mainly form smoking will find mood can drop substantially.
nicotine lot things brain body.

00:19:55 Nicotine Found? Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

like begin talking exactly nicotine impacts
brain body. nicotine found? Now obviously nicotine
found tobacco plant, nicotine also found nightshades. tomatoes,
eggplant, sweet peppers. Although concentrations nicotine tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers vastly lower tobacco plant. actually
can also find nicotine potatoes. Now nicotine present potatoes tomatoes
tobacco plant all? Well, nicotine plant alkaloid. get alkaloids
little bit later, thought alkaloids evolved plants way prevent
insects eating them. without going lot insect biology, reason
rationale behind explanation nicotine not substance tobacco
people use various medications people use, also used
pesticide can dramatically disrupt nervous system insects. can render
infertile, not say renders humans infertile. want say, again,
not case nicotine renders humans infertile, can make certain insects
infertile. can actually disrupt motor function brain function,
reasons different effects insects, words, can kill
prevent reproducing, therefore explains plants probably evolved
plant alkaloid, nicotine. humans, differences receptors


nicotine, located, types receptors, effects nicotine
humans quite bit different. again, not cause infertility humans.
Although will talk little bit later double blind peer-reviewed studies
conducted humans indicate instance, nicotine can reduce penile girth,
girth penis, can lead certain forms sexual dysfunction.
changes largely downstream changes blood flow endothelial cell function.
Endothelial cells cells make blood vessels vascular type
tissues within brain body. nicotine found plants. can
know sure point human evolution, somebody group
people, either, here, completely guessing, just story, someone
group must inhaled smoke tobacco plant put dried leaves
tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors

haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.

ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic

Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called

reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part

smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social

nicotine nicotine impacts brains, bodies, mental performance,
mental health, physical performance, physical health. Now again,
want remind everybody really need separate discussion
nicotine discussion delivery device nicotine. words,
talking nicotine, not necessarily talking smoking. Although
might be. things associated smoking vaping means
getting nicotine system effects, negative,
cases positive. Indeed later, will talk can actually use nicotine get
smoking addiction. won't come surprise many people,
perhaps will come surprise fact many people actually use nicotine-like
substances nicotine order relieve nicotine addiction. talk
looks like offer various protocols later episode. also
want mention outset long standing interest nicotine. fact,
early scientific career, research nicotine role brain development.
long standing interest neuroplasticity, brain's ability change


response experience. experiments done close colleagues
friends mine really emphasized fact acetylcholine, particular,
acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors, something learn
little bit, can actually serve gateway trigger directed rewiring
brain. fascinating. think nicotine something take,
actually receptors locations brain nicotine binds can
exert effects. receptors not come existence
tobacco existence vaping pens, existence anything
outside world. fact nicotinic receptors brain body tells
acetylcholine nicotine important roles normal brain
body function, much often like point anecdote well known
Nobel prize winning neuroscientist. won't reveal are. not faculty
member Stanford, many neuroscientists know person many people
outside world know person. also well known love
nicotine. sat person's office, he, will reveal he, consumed no
fewer three pieces nicotine gum relatively short conversation
45 minutes. surprising me. asked taking much
nicotine nicotine gum. replied years, chronic
smoker, one hand greatly impaired cardiovascular health
fitness, no surprise there. talk little bit underlying
reasons are, everyone, not everyone knows smoking cigarettes
smoking general really impairs lung health. just simply no question it.
less unhealthy ways smoke, quite honest message
smoking kind going disrupt lung endothelial function, lung function, blood
vessels, forth. going make harder breathe vigor, take deep
breaths, deliver oxygen tissues, et cetera. said, also pointed data
nicotine specifically pointing fact nicotine can be, can protective
certain forms cognitive impairment. continued chew
nicotine containing gum. swore focus enhancing motivation
enhancing effects nicotine containing gum. Now not call arms
run start chewing consuming nicotine containing products. will talk
products later episode, potential advantages,
potential disadvantages. Now share anecdote nicely separates nicotine
delivery device nicotine arrives. Now haven't talked


individual years see whether not nicotine working stave off kind
Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cognitive impairment come age.
gentleman getting years seems quite sharp nonetheless,
always exceedingly sharp. point nicotine substance can
promote cognitive function, conditions, taken inappropriate,
say extreme dosages, can also impair cognitive function. today really
need nuanced conversation nicotine, one includes
benefits, drawbacks, particular children, certainly people
pregnant, people addictive tendencies, people depression
kind mood disorders. will tell soon nicotine can
powerful mood modulator many people tried quit nicotine
mainly form smoking will find mood can drop substantially.
nicotine lot things brain body.

00:19:55 Nicotine Found? Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

like begin talking exactly nicotine impacts
brain body. nicotine found? Now obviously nicotine
found tobacco plant, nicotine also found nightshades. tomatoes,
eggplant, sweet peppers. Although concentrations nicotine tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers vastly lower tobacco plant. actually
can also find nicotine potatoes. Now nicotine present potatoes tomatoes
tobacco plant all? Well, nicotine plant alkaloid. get alkaloids
little bit later, thought alkaloids evolved plants way prevent
insects eating them. without going lot insect biology, reason
rationale behind explanation nicotine not substance tobacco
people use various medications people use, also used
pesticide can dramatically disrupt nervous system insects. can render
infertile, not say renders humans infertile. want say, again,
not case nicotine renders humans infertile, can make certain insects
infertile. can actually disrupt motor function brain function,
reasons different effects insects, words, can kill
prevent reproducing, therefore explains plants probably evolved
plant alkaloid, nicotine. humans, differences receptors


nicotine, located, types receptors, effects nicotine
humans quite bit different. again, not cause infertility humans.
Although will talk little bit later double blind peer-reviewed studies
conducted humans indicate instance, nicotine can reduce penile girth,
girth penis, can lead certain forms sexual dysfunction.
changes largely downstream changes blood flow endothelial cell function.
Endothelial cells cells make blood vessels vascular type
tissues within brain body. nicotine found plants. can
know sure point human evolution, somebody group
people, either, here, completely guessing, just story, someone
group must inhaled smoke tobacco plant put dried leaves
tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors
acetylcholinergic variety. know lot think lot hear
haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.
binds receptors, little parking spots cells, changes way
cells behave. cells can increase activity release chemicals.
can become electrically active, can number different things.


ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic
background just like humans. family acetylcholine receptors
nicotinic variety. maybe one street neighborhood, know
Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Today really simple. Nicotine binds
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bunch different ones bunch
different tissues.

00:25:12 Nicotine & Effects Brain: Appetite, Dopamine & GABA

body, so-called central nervous system periphery. Although want
point spinal cord part central nervous system. fairness
reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part
binding alpha four beta two receptor particular area brain. going
return little bit, ever heard nicotine kills appetite,
indeed does. not behavior smoking itself. not always

within brain, nicotine binds alpha four beta two receptor various locations

smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social
media time time, say, wait, didn't mention alpha two beta six

today's discussion ease digestibility this, just want point
norepinephrine, epinephrine, adrenaline, going treat common pool
similar, fact, similar molecules net effect, least

nicotine nicotine impacts brains, bodies, mental performance,
mental health, physical performance, physical health. Now again,
want remind everybody really need separate discussion
nicotine discussion delivery device nicotine. words,
talking nicotine, not necessarily talking smoking. Although
might be. things associated smoking vaping means
getting nicotine system effects, negative,
cases positive. Indeed later, will talk can actually use nicotine get
smoking addiction. won't come surprise many people,
perhaps will come surprise fact many people actually use nicotine-like
substances nicotine order relieve nicotine addiction. talk
looks like offer various protocols later episode. also
want mention outset long standing interest nicotine. fact,
early scientific career, research nicotine role brain development.
long standing interest neuroplasticity, brain's ability change


response experience. experiments done close colleagues
friends mine really emphasized fact acetylcholine, particular,
acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors, something learn
little bit, can actually serve gateway trigger directed rewiring
brain. fascinating. think nicotine something take,
actually receptors locations brain nicotine binds can
exert effects. receptors not come existence
tobacco existence vaping pens, existence anything
outside world. fact nicotinic receptors brain body tells
acetylcholine nicotine important roles normal brain
body function, much often like point anecdote well known
Nobel prize winning neuroscientist. won't reveal are. not faculty
member Stanford, many neuroscientists know person many people
outside world know person. also well known love
nicotine. sat person's office, he, will reveal he, consumed no
fewer three pieces nicotine gum relatively short conversation
45 minutes. surprising me. asked taking much
nicotine nicotine gum. replied years, chronic
smoker, one hand greatly impaired cardiovascular health
fitness, no surprise there. talk little bit underlying
reasons are, everyone, not everyone knows smoking cigarettes
smoking general really impairs lung health. just simply no question it.
less unhealthy ways smoke, quite honest message
smoking kind going disrupt lung endothelial function, lung function, blood
vessels, forth. going make harder breathe vigor, take deep
breaths, deliver oxygen tissues, et cetera. said, also pointed data
nicotine specifically pointing fact nicotine can be, can protective
certain forms cognitive impairment. continued chew
nicotine containing gum. swore focus enhancing motivation
enhancing effects nicotine containing gum. Now not call arms
run start chewing consuming nicotine containing products. will talk
products later episode, potential advantages,
potential disadvantages. Now share anecdote nicely separates nicotine
delivery device nicotine arrives. Now haven't talked


individual years see whether not nicotine working stave off kind
Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cognitive impairment come age.
gentleman getting years seems quite sharp nonetheless,
always exceedingly sharp. point nicotine substance can
promote cognitive function, conditions, taken inappropriate,
say extreme dosages, can also impair cognitive function. today really
need nuanced conversation nicotine, one includes
benefits, drawbacks, particular children, certainly people
pregnant, people addictive tendencies, people depression
kind mood disorders. will tell soon nicotine can
powerful mood modulator many people tried quit nicotine
mainly form smoking will find mood can drop substantially.
nicotine lot things brain body.

00:19:55 Nicotine Found? Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

like begin talking exactly nicotine impacts
brain body. nicotine found? Now obviously nicotine
found tobacco plant, nicotine also found nightshades. tomatoes,
eggplant, sweet peppers. Although concentrations nicotine tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers vastly lower tobacco plant. actually
can also find nicotine potatoes. Now nicotine present potatoes tomatoes
tobacco plant all? Well, nicotine plant alkaloid. get alkaloids
little bit later, thought alkaloids evolved plants way prevent
insects eating them. without going lot insect biology, reason
rationale behind explanation nicotine not substance tobacco
people use various medications people use, also used
pesticide can dramatically disrupt nervous system insects. can render
infertile, not say renders humans infertile. want say, again,
not case nicotine renders humans infertile, can make certain insects
infertile. can actually disrupt motor function brain function,
reasons different effects insects, words, can kill
prevent reproducing, therefore explains plants probably evolved
plant alkaloid, nicotine. humans, differences receptors


nicotine, located, types receptors, effects nicotine
humans quite bit different. again, not cause infertility humans.
Although will talk little bit later double blind peer-reviewed studies
conducted humans indicate instance, nicotine can reduce penile girth,
girth penis, can lead certain forms sexual dysfunction.
changes largely downstream changes blood flow endothelial cell function.
Endothelial cells cells make blood vessels vascular type
tissues within brain body. nicotine found plants. can
know sure point human evolution, somebody group
people, either, here, completely guessing, just story, someone
group must inhaled smoke tobacco plant put dried leaves
tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors
acetylcholinergic variety. know lot think lot hear
haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.
binds receptors, little parking spots cells, changes way
cells behave. cells can increase activity release chemicals.
can become electrically active, can number different things.


ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic
background just like humans. family acetylcholine receptors
nicotinic variety. maybe one street neighborhood, know
Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Today really simple. Nicotine binds
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bunch different ones bunch
different tissues.

00:25:12 Nicotine & Effects Brain: Appetite, Dopamine & GABA

differences receptors dictate sorts effects nicotine will
tissues. talk effects are, dividing
effects nicotine effects brain, everything neck up,
body, so-called central nervous system periphery. Although want
point spinal cord part central nervous system. fairness
reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part
binding alpha four beta two receptor particular area brain. going
return little bit, ever heard nicotine kills appetite,
indeed does. not behavior smoking itself. not always
cigarette mouth not eating food. Although suppose might
minor effect. direct effects nicotine appetite, is, reduces


appetite direct effects metabolism, is, increases metabolism
effects areas brain body talk moment. Now
within brain, nicotine binds alpha four beta two receptor various locations
brain. three maybe fourth talk neurochemical
effects nicotine ingest it. First things first, ingest nicotine
smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

really front back brain, can serve two major role,
are. Acetylcholine released nucleus basalis leads sort spotlighting
highlighting particular neural circuits brain. mean this? Well
say working puzzle. say cognitive puzzle. Maybe
word puzzle, nowadays heard Wordle thing. Twitter people
always posting Wordle thing no idea is, guessing
sort puzzle. guessing like crossword puzzle, here, wrong,
don't know, educate me. Tell Wordle is. Somebody put comments

feels good makes us feel motivated. increase acetylcholine,
especially nucleus basalis front brain, reason can increase

doing, maybe even particular physical work. Although mention anytime
pairing words nicotine physical work, obvious ways
smoking impairs lung function, two things really run counter one another.
words, thinking ingesting nicotine smoking vaping
order improve physical performance, terrible idea.

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social
media time time, say, wait, didn't mention alpha two beta six
receptor yet. Okay look, get it. splitters room, sake
today's discussion ease digestibility this, just want point
norepinephrine, epinephrine, adrenaline, going treat common pool
similar, fact, similar molecules net effect, least
context discussion increase levels alertness, energy, arousal.
way nicotine accomplishes increases alertness arousal
energy within brain triggering release no epinephrine little cluster
neurons back brain called locus coeruleus, tiny cluster neurons
offers up, say has, always birth little
wires, axons extend many, many places brain, not every place,
virtually every place can sprinkler brain norepinephrine, essentially serve
wake signal, elevating levels energy. combines


acetylcholine nucleus basalis, causes attentional spotlighting, increases
concentration focus, feel good properties dopamine
motivating properties dopamine released mesolimbic reward pathway. Now
can start get picture nicotine powerful molecule. making
people feel motivated good. making people feel focused makes people
feel alert otherwise feel little bit sleepy. really powerful
compound, fact, going back earlier discussion focus tools
focus, encourage interested please check episode focus,
number different tools protocols increase focus.
talking one molecule, nicotine, found plants like tomatoes potatoes
tobacco plant. can synthesized laboratory ingested
patch gum even pill toothpick dipped nicotine. One molecule can
trigger activation circuits focus motivation one fell swoop.
remarkable. absolutely remarkable. haven't even touched
psychological components focus, right? Whether not interested
something, whether not excited not. very, powerful
system. powerful fact, think can really place nicotine right
top, right next caffeine molecule fundamentally changed human
evolution, human consciousness, human experience. Even somebody
never ingested nicotine, absolutely true
nicotinic receptors, say acetylcholine naturally released without
external trigger within brain body, say without trigger
nicotine particular binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

00:41:10 Nicotine & Effects Appetite & Metabolism

creating effects brain body, just absolutely staggering. Now
earlier mentioned appetite suppressing indeed metabolism increasing effects
nicotine. fairly niche component nicotine does, mean,
important one, not major reason people consume nicotine. like
take moment talk now, brain talking
effects nicotine brain. seems appropriate time
talk this. Now can conversation nicotine appetite
metabolism simple straightforward way. like learn


biology metabolism appetite things mediated neural
components, not just stuff like liver, et cetera, episodes that,
really neural components hunger appetite. encourage check

discussion important, right now, appears provided dosages kept
reasonable. talk reasonable means little later, frequency
kept relatively low. not relying things constantly. may fact
benefit ingesting nicotine time time, provided not still developing
brain. Now reality, neuroplasticity goes throughout lifetime. life
actually one long developmental arc. not like development occurs stops,
certainly people puberty, puberty, probably next 15 20
years puberty, avoiding nicotine probably good idea. Now course,
development entire life. not like development starts ends,
certainly people 25 years old younger, ingesting nicotine way
enhance cognitive function probably not best idea. certainly, please,
15 years old younger, ingesting nicotine form, unless
prescribed doctor specific clinical reason, seems just like
terrible idea based data read. reason going
create scenario nicotine dependence order achieve heightened levels mood

addiction nicotine directly, not necessarily delivery device method like smoking
vaping, although pull addictive habit forming behavior well,
want let neural circuits develop point again, unless
clinical need prescribed drug licensed physician psychiatrist, et cetera,
not relying chemical enhancement circuits. people 25


years older, again, not strict cutoff, roughly 25 years older,
thinking using nicotine enhance cognitive function
adults brain development slowing down, right. Never ceases, slowing
slowed point say developmental plasticity
largely now operating context adult neuroplasticity. Well,
case, may instances increasing acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,
way nicotine ingestion might good idea, certainly not smoking, vaping,

00:58:35 Smoking, Vaping, Dipping & Snuffing: Carcinogens & Endothelial Cells

direct contact tobacco mucosal lining tissue mouth nose,
called dipping snuffing. last 20 minutes so, talking
biology nicotine specifically, impacts brain, impacts body,
feels good, can enhance focus. largely set aside smoking, vaping,
dipping tobacco, snuffing, negative effects mental
physical health. Working top head bottom feet, can
say smoking, vaping, dipping, snuffing negatively impact every organ tissue
system cell body virtue fact damage endothelial
cells. Again, endothelial cells cells make vasculature,
delivers blood nutrients cells organs tissues body.
endothelial cells strongly negatively impacted practices
just described. Now way happens varies little bit one
next, instance, estimated cigarettes contain anywhere 4,000
7,000 toxins. Now word toxins real buzzword days, hear
detoxes toxins, specifically, know contains carcinogens.
cancer promoting compounds. instance, know tar cigarettes, even
low tar cigarettes, well ammonia within cigarettes, well formaldehyde
contained within cigarettes, well carbon dioxide generated smoking
cigarettes carcinogens. Carbon dioxide also negative effect
depleting amount oxygen delivered tissues way
impact carbon dioxide binding hemoglobin preventing hemoglobin
delivering oxygen tissues body. may 4,000 4,500
7,000 toxins, depending cigarette, papers happen rolled in,
whether not filtered non-filtered, type tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,


tremendous number toxins. potent carcinogens
within long list toxins. Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide
potent carcinogens. Now fact carcinogens
cigarettes sometimes lead cigarette smokers particularly cigarette smokers
hardest time quitting enjoy cigarettes saying, well,
listen, everything carcinogen everything kills you. Well certainly not true
statement. carcinogens environment, environmental
hazards like solvents. even work laboratory, instance, use
laboratory, DNA intercalating dyes, literally dyes allow us see DNA
structure cells see proteins make see RNAs make.
important wear gloves work things, name
suggests, intercalate, actually get strands DNA separate
them. mutagens, mutate DNA. often carcinogens well.
laboratory, take certain precautions not negatively
impact health, safety protocols on. hear carcinogens car
exhaust bus exhaust sorts things like pesticides true.
argument probabilities, one say, well,
carcinogens environment, compound carcinogenic effect
smoking vaping dipping snuffing? usually doesn't get people quit
smoking things powerful reinforcing effects nicotine

not really nicotine, dopamine nicotine evokes.
not really dopamine nicotine evokes directly per se,

01:02:34 Smoking, Vaping, Dipping & Snuffing: Negative Impacts Lifespan & Health

also positive effects increased dopamine results in. can
easily circle back negative effects smoking, vaping, dipping, snuffing,
say endothelial cells disrupted. endothelial cells involved delivery
blood nutrients every tissue body smoking vaping, dipping,


snuffing contain carcinogens, cancer promoting.
epidemiological studies there, can actually arrive clear numbers
much life one will lose ingesting nicotine way four delivery

mention many people vaping also smoking cigarettes becoming
increasingly common. lot people using vaping one context cigarettes
another, dipping one context, vaping another. even smoke
vape dip snuff, negative effects dramatic calculable.
thought every pack cigarettes consumed per day, average
two day cigarette smoker pack day cigarette smoker, two pack
day. every pack cigarettes smoked per day, can reliably estimate 14 year
reduction lifespan. cigarettes literally peeling years off life. Now
way brain works way human beings anticipate future
can grounded present future present past,
just mind works, right? can think future, also realize

tobacco plant mucosal tissue, know different mucosal
linings body substances can pass through, right.
mucosal soft lining tissues body will allow certain substances, not certain
substances pass in. people can put tobacco mouth certain
amount nicotine makes bloodstream, put tobacco nose, certain
amount nicotine gets bloodstream. haven't heard people putting tobacco
orifices body containing mucosal tissue. certainly not suggesting
people that, get idea nicotine gets plants, dried
leaves bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads heat induced change
availability nicotine. smoking tobacco vaping tobacco, simply
heating up, allows nicotine liberated go bloodstream simply
inhaling lungs. will get back smoking various kinds later. right now
just keep attention nicotine pulled plants
human body. Now whether inhalation whether not placing contact
mucosal tissue mouth mucosal containing orifice body, nicotine
gets bloodstream. bloodstream, exerts effects
binds certain so-called nicotinic receptors. nicotinic receptors
acetylcholinergic variety. know lot think lot hear
haven't heard this, actually quite simple. Anyone can understand this.
Acetylcholine molecule, chemical released brain body.
binds receptors, little parking spots cells, changes way
cells behave. cells can increase activity release chemicals.
can become electrically active, can number different things.


ingest nicotine, gets bloodstream eventually will get
brain gets body. brain body,
so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Now so-called family, indeed
family, refer groups receptors related design genetic
background just like humans. family acetylcholine receptors
nicotinic variety. maybe one street neighborhood, know
Joneses another street, know Chows another street, well body,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so-called
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Today really simple. Nicotine binds
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bunch different ones bunch
different tissues.

reality, brain spinal cord central nervous system. Everything else
considered periphery. Now lot different nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, want know, aficionados, ultra
curious this, main effects nicotine brain mediated nicotine
binding so-called alpha four beta two receptor. Alpha four beta two receptor. Even
don't care receptor subtypes, going come later discuss
nicotine suppresses appetite. fact, one major reasons people don't
want quit smoking, quit smoking another form ingesting nicotine,
relapse, go back smoking ingesting nicotine way
indeed nicotine will increase metabolism reduce hunger large part

smoking nicotine containing tobacco, place tobacco contact mucosal
lining nasal passages mouth, takes two 15 minutes nicotine
enter bloodstream. Smoking hits bloodstream faster, vaping even faster,
mention variety reasons placing tobacco directly contact
mucosal lining going slowest. Now mentioned before, nicotine gets
bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central

related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical

endothelial cells strongly negatively impacted practices
just described. Now way happens varies little bit one
next, instance, estimated cigarettes contain anywhere 4,000
7,000 toxins. Now word toxins real buzzword days, hear
detoxes toxins, specifically, know contains carcinogens.
cancer promoting compounds. instance, know tar cigarettes, even

potent carcinogens. Now fact carcinogens
cigarettes sometimes lead cigarette smokers particularly cigarette smokers
hardest time quitting enjoy cigarettes saying, well,
listen, everything carcinogen everything kills you. Well certainly not true
statement. carcinogens environment, environmental
hazards like solvents. even work laboratory, instance, use
laboratory, DNA intercalating dyes, literally dyes allow us see DNA

thought every pack cigarettes consumed per day, average
two day cigarette smoker pack day cigarette smoker, two pack

01:09:23 Quit Smoking, Nicotine Cravings & Withdrawal

among leading causes preventable death debilitating life conditions,
may lead question world people this? Well
turns don't want to. best surveys one can find
quit smoking, quit vaping, you, find least
cigarette smokers, 70% want quit. love quit. yet find
exceedingly difficult. reason find exceedingly difficult
brain neurochemistry talked before. reason spent close 20

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line
increases morning typically body temperature autonomic

right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call

know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,

longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine

four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.

waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind

right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind

autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little

talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call
withdrawal phase. now happens say, it, going cold turkey.
know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,
homeostatic mechanism brain body sets level mood arousal,
et cetera, not know hasn't adjusted fact not bringing
nicotine. not cigarette. not inhalation vape
pen. ends happening baseline, adjusted
offset increases mood alertness, et cetera, smoke vape lower
normally be. 9:00 cigarette time vape inhalation time no
longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine
different methods simply get cognitive boost. certain circumstances
might appropriate occasional work about, certainly not physical
exercise, given talked earlier, course
approaches increasing, not just nicotine, acetylcholine generally order
achieve cognitive enhancement physical enhancement, say physical
performance enhancement. talked earlier, Alpha GPC.
event, nicotine, now clear, immensely powerful substance. One
commonly ingested substances face earth

bloodstream nicotine can pass so-called blood brain
barrier, BBB, basically fence around brain, can pass
blood brain barrier, going rapid effects brain
four major categories neurochemicals neural circuits. first
categories, important one, one brought episode
dopamine, motivation, drive. think not just scientists, human beings
know within brain, called mesolimbic reward
pathway. mesolimbic reward pathway just want call it, dopamine reward
pathway is, name suggests, set connections brain area called
ventral tegmental area. don't remember names things,
course, want to, fine too. ventral tegmental area VTA connects
another area called nucleus accumbens. Now important. Nicotine
triggers release dopamine nucleus accumbens. gives
nicotine rewarding properties. increases motivation. tends give not subtle,
transient increase feelings wellbeing alertness motivation.
increase dopamine caused nicotine directly within nucleus
accumbens. Nicotine also triggers release certain neurochemicals ventral
tegmental area itself. impinge nucleus accumbens increase dopamine
levels further. makes rewarding properties sometimes referred
reinforcing properties nicotine powerful. many billions people
ingest nicotine one form another. also nicotine hard quit
potent increase dopamine multiple neural circuit pathways within
mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now within mesolimbic reward circuitry,
interesting feature. accelerators essentially push dopamine, get


dopamine released, breaks so-called GABAergic variety.
GABA's inhibitory neurotransmitter. don't need know much just
understand nicotine increases dopamine, also decreases activity
GABA. like pushing accelerator dopamine, also removing
brake. two pronged effect nicotine reinforcement reward dopamine
related pathways, feel good motivation pathways. increase
dopamine decrease GABA. again, mediated
mesolimbic reward pathway, involving ventral tegmental area nucleus
accumbens. can conceptualize even just 5% just told you, even
can just remember nicotine increases dopamine feels good,
makes want it, will everything need know mind order
understand nicotine highly used, indeed abused, hard
quit, will point avenues quit reduce intake. also points
nicotine can actually used antidepressant way choose.
will talk various criteria choosing that, just understand
nicotine increases motivation,

00:37:29 Nicotine, Norepinephrine & Alertness/Energy

logic isn't health detriments certainly there. third
neurochemical pathway strongly activated nicotine brought central
nervous system brain epinephrine, particular norepinephrine,
related epinephrine. Now, earlier said epinephrine adrenaline.
still true. Norepinephrine closely related epinephrine, today's discussion,
going use interchangeably. Although realize say medical
students biology students probably going minor seizure
lump norepinephrine epinephrine. don't much lumper,
science, talk lumpers splitters. Lumpers people like oversimplify
little bit, splitters people really like detail. see lot splitters social
media time time, say, wait, didn't mention alpha two beta six

today's discussion ease digestibility this, just want point
norepinephrine, epinephrine, adrenaline, going treat common pool
similar, fact, similar molecules net effect, least

can start get picture nicotine powerful molecule. making
people feel motivated good. making people feel focused makes people
feel alert otherwise feel little bit sleepy. really powerful
compound, fact, going back earlier discussion focus tools

number different tools protocols increase focus.
talking one molecule, nicotine, found plants like tomatoes potatoes

patch gum even pill toothpick dipped nicotine. One molecule can
trigger activation circuits focus motivation one fell swoop.
remarkable. absolutely remarkable. haven't even touched
psychological components focus, right? Whether not interested
something, whether not excited not. very, powerful

nicotine particular binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

00:41:10 Nicotine & Effects Appetite & Metabolism

creating effects brain body, just absolutely staggering. Now
earlier mentioned appetite suppressing indeed metabolism increasing effects
nicotine. fairly niche component nicotine does, mean,
important one, not major reason people consume nicotine. like
take moment talk now, brain talking
effects nicotine brain. seems appropriate time
talk this. Now can conversation nicotine appetite
metabolism simple straightforward way. like learn


biology metabolism appetite things mediated neural
components, not just stuff like liver, et cetera, episodes that,

discussion important, right now, appears provided dosages kept
reasonable. talk reasonable means little later, frequency
kept relatively low. not relying things constantly. may fact
benefit ingesting nicotine time time, provided not still developing
brain. Now reality, neuroplasticity goes throughout lifetime. life
actually one long developmental arc. not like development occurs stops,
certainly people puberty, puberty, probably next 15 20
years puberty, avoiding nicotine probably good idea. Now course,
development entire life. not like development starts ends,
certainly people 25 years old younger, ingesting nicotine way
enhance cognitive function probably not best idea. certainly, please,
15 years old younger, ingesting nicotine form, unless
prescribed doctor specific clinical reason, seems just like
terrible idea based data read. reason going
create scenario nicotine dependence order achieve heightened levels mood

not relying chemical enhancement circuits. people 25


years older, again, not strict cutoff, roughly 25 years older,
thinking using nicotine enhance cognitive function
adults brain development slowing down, right. Never ceases, slowing
slowed point say developmental plasticity
largely now operating context adult neuroplasticity. Well,

00:58:35 Smoking, Vaping, Dipping & Snuffing: Carcinogens & Endothelial Cells

direct contact tobacco mucosal lining tissue mouth nose,
called dipping snuffing. last 20 minutes so, talking
biology nicotine specifically, impacts brain, impacts body,
feels good, can enhance focus. largely set aside smoking, vaping,
dipping tobacco, snuffing, negative effects mental
physical health. Working top head bottom feet, can
say smoking, vaping, dipping, snuffing negatively impact every organ tissue
system cell body virtue fact damage endothelial
cells. Again, endothelial cells cells make vasculature,
delivers blood nutrients cells organs tissues body.
endothelial cells strongly negatively impacted practices
just described. Now way happens varies little bit one
next, instance, estimated cigarettes contain anywhere 4,000
7,000 toxins. Now word toxins real buzzword days, hear
detoxes toxins, specifically, know contains carcinogens.
cancer promoting compounds. instance, know tar cigarettes, even
low tar cigarettes, well ammonia within cigarettes, well formaldehyde
contained within cigarettes, well carbon dioxide generated smoking
cigarettes carcinogens. Carbon dioxide also negative effect
depleting amount oxygen delivered tissues way
impact carbon dioxide binding hemoglobin preventing hemoglobin
delivering oxygen tissues body. may 4,000 4,500
7,000 toxins, depending cigarette, papers happen rolled in,
whether not filtered non-filtered, type tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,


tremendous number toxins. potent carcinogens
within long list toxins. Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide
potent carcinogens. Now fact carcinogens
cigarettes sometimes lead cigarette smokers particularly cigarette smokers
hardest time quitting enjoy cigarettes saying, well,
listen, everything carcinogen everything kills you. Well certainly not true
statement. carcinogens environment, environmental
hazards like solvents. even work laboratory, instance, use
laboratory, DNA intercalating dyes, literally dyes allow us see DNA
structure cells see proteins make see RNAs make.
important wear gloves work things, name
suggests, intercalate, actually get strands DNA separate
them. mutagens, mutate DNA. often carcinogens well.
laboratory, take certain precautions not negatively
impact health, safety protocols on. hear carcinogens car
exhaust bus exhaust sorts things like pesticides true.
argument probabilities, one say, well,
carcinogens environment, compound carcinogenic effect
smoking vaping dipping snuffing? usually doesn't get people quit
smoking things powerful reinforcing effects nicotine
itself. again, nicotine reinforcing element way triggering dopamine
reinforcement pathway, mesolimbic reward pathway. course
additional effects increased focus, increased ability pay attention

compounding rewards. not really cigarette, nicotine,
not really nicotine, dopamine nicotine evokes.
not really dopamine nicotine evokes directly per se,

01:02:34 Smoking, Vaping, Dipping & Snuffing: Negative Impacts Lifespan & Health

also positive effects increased dopamine results in. can
easily circle back negative effects smoking, vaping, dipping, snuffing,
say endothelial cells disrupted. endothelial cells involved delivery
blood nutrients every tissue body smoking vaping, dipping,


snuffing contain carcinogens, cancer promoting.
epidemiological studies there, can actually arrive clear numbers
much life one will lose ingesting nicotine way four delivery
devices, say one four delivery devices. Although also
mention many people vaping also smoking cigarettes becoming
increasingly common. lot people using vaping one context cigarettes
another, dipping one context, vaping another. even smoke
vape dip snuff, negative effects dramatic calculable.
thought every pack cigarettes consumed per day, average
two day cigarette smoker pack day cigarette smoker, two pack
day. every pack cigarettes smoked per day, can reliably estimate 14 year
reduction lifespan. cigarettes literally peeling years off life. Now
way brain works way human beings anticipate future
can grounded present future present past,
just mind works, right? can think future, also realize
time space today. that, many people will say, well,
enjoy cigarettes enjoy vaping. least here, enjoying it.

smoking again. Despite fear negative health effects, not going ever
smoke again. Despite financial cost, health cost. list off huge number
things negative, already know heard them,
makes skin worse, mentioned lowers libido, disrupts hormones, disrupts
vascular function, brain function. terrible things. yet people
try quit simply can't. 5% succeed quitting, full 65%
relapse within year. depressing picture, not say people
cannot quit. fact, can. couple methods shown

guest Huberman Lab Podcast, world expert, not
world expert clinical applications hypnosis. Now say hypnosis, lot
people think stage hypnosis, hypnotist trying get people certain
things say certain things, not necessarily will actually
agree. hypnotist dictating person thinks, says, does.
Clinical hypnosis vastly different that. Clinical hypnosis person,
patient actually directs brain changes toward specific emotional behavioral
goal. Work Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory done 1993, now
repeated many, many times carried modern studies
will provide links studies show note captions can access
them. studies shown using specific form hypnosis, people can


achieve complete total cessation cigarette smoking. no reason
believe doesn't also carry vaping one single hypnosis session.
success rates incredibly high one considers normally
5% success rate. success rate particular hypnosis developed Stanford
School Medicine Dr. David Spiegel 23% people hypnosis one time
succeed quitting smoking. Now old days, actually wasn't long ago,

quite nicely vaping. details number statistics, fact every year,
700,000 people die smoking related diseases.

smoking nowadays. even though see less smoking, typically
US Canada, even Northern Europe, places, still many many
people smoking like quit, 75% people, least according

again, not psychiatrist, not telling take Bupropion, AKA Wellbutrin,
going give little bit contour typically done terms


Bupropion administration help people get relief withdrawal

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line
increases morning typically body temperature autonomic

right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call

know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,

longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine
different methods simply get cognitive boost. certain circumstances
might appropriate occasional work about, certainly not physical
exercise, given talked earlier, course
approaches increasing, not just nicotine, acetylcholine generally order

notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent

period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across

nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take

Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used

nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important

people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely

cigarette smoking people. Now mean cigarette smoking fairly
easy quit people? No. 70% people smoke cigarettes report
like quit thought could. success rate quitting smoking
people try go just cold turkey, just quit no assistance whatsoever. might tell
family friends, hey, quitting, it, exceedingly low, 5%. 5%
people say, it, not smoking again. Despite cancer diagnosis, not
smoking again. Despite fear negative health effects, not going ever
smoke again. Despite financial cost, health cost. list off huge number
things negative, already know heard them,
makes skin worse, mentioned lowers libido, disrupts hormones, disrupts
vascular function, brain function. terrible things. yet people
try quit simply can't. 5% succeed quitting, full 65%

people think stage hypnosis, hypnotist trying get people certain
things say certain things, not necessarily will actually
agree. hypnotist dictating person thinks, says, does.
Clinical hypnosis vastly different that. Clinical hypnosis person,
patient actually directs brain changes toward specific emotional behavioral
goal. Work Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory done 1993, now
repeated many, many times carried modern studies
will provide links studies show note captions can access

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe

talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing

Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high

longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line
increases morning typically body temperature autonomic
arousal increase. towards afternoon, going come sloping down.
right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call
withdrawal phase. now happens say, it, going cold turkey.
know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,
homeostatic mechanism brain body sets level mood arousal,
et cetera, not know hasn't adjusted fact not bringing
nicotine. not cigarette. not inhalation vape
pen. ends happening baseline, adjusted
offset increases mood alertness, et cetera, smoke vape lower
normally be. 9:00 cigarette time vape inhalation time no
longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine
different methods simply get cognitive boost. certain circumstances

makes vaping particular hard quit. Vaping actually harder quit
cigarette smoking people. Now mean cigarette smoking fairly
easy quit people? No. 70% people smoke cigarettes report
like quit thought could. success rate quitting smoking
people try go just cold turkey, just quit no assistance whatsoever. might tell
family friends, hey, quitting, it, exceedingly low, 5%. 5%
people say, it, not smoking again. Despite cancer diagnosis, not
smoking again. Despite fear negative health effects, not going ever
smoke again. Despite financial cost, health cost. list off huge number
things negative, already know heard them,
makes skin worse, mentioned lowers libido, disrupts hormones, disrupts
vascular function, brain function. terrible things. yet people
try quit simply can't. 5% succeed quitting, full 65%
relapse within year. depressing picture, not say people
cannot quit. fact, can. couple methods shown
help people quit. behavioral pharmacologic. just want
touch behavioral ones first turns quite powerful
method quitting nicotine ingestion way cigarette smoking, also carries
vaping. beautiful work done colleague, fact, close
collaborator, although not involved research describe
Stanford. name Dr. David Spiegel. associate chair psychiatry.
guest Huberman Lab Podcast, world expert, not
world expert clinical applications hypnosis. Now say hypnosis, lot
people think stage hypnosis, hypnotist trying get people certain
things say certain things, not necessarily will actually
agree. hypnotist dictating person thinks, says, does.
Clinical hypnosis vastly different that. Clinical hypnosis person,
patient actually directs brain changes toward specific emotional behavioral
goal. Work Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory done 1993, now
repeated many, many times carried modern studies
will provide links studies show note captions can access
them. studies shown using specific form hypnosis, people can


achieve complete total cessation cigarette smoking. no reason
believe doesn't also carry vaping one single hypnosis session.
success rates incredibly high one considers normally
5% success rate. success rate particular hypnosis developed Stanford
School Medicine Dr. David Spiegel 23% people hypnosis one time
succeed quitting smoking. Now old days, actually wasn't long ago,
advent smartphones internet took off extent
now, done someone come clinic Dr. Spiegel
one colleagues take somebody hypnosis. Nowadays, can

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line

right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high

know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,

longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine
different methods simply get cognitive boost. certain circumstances
might appropriate occasional work about, certainly not physical
exercise, given talked earlier, course

endothelial cells strongly negatively impacted practices
just described. Now way happens varies little bit one
next, instance, estimated cigarettes contain anywhere 4,000
7,000 toxins. Now word toxins real buzzword days, hear
detoxes toxins, specifically, know contains carcinogens.
cancer promoting compounds. instance, know tar cigarettes, even
low tar cigarettes, well ammonia within cigarettes, well formaldehyde

tremendous number toxins. potent carcinogens
within long list toxins. Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide
potent carcinogens. Now fact carcinogens
cigarettes sometimes lead cigarette smokers particularly cigarette smokers
hardest time quitting enjoy cigarettes saying, well,
listen, everything carcinogen everything kills you. Well certainly not true
statement. carcinogens environment, environmental
hazards like solvents. even work laboratory, instance, use
laboratory, DNA intercalating dyes, literally dyes allow us see DNA

also positive effects increased dopamine results in. can
easily circle back negative effects smoking, vaping, dipping, snuffing,
say endothelial cells disrupted. endothelial cells involved delivery
blood nutrients every tissue body smoking vaping, dipping,


snuffing contain carcinogens, cancer promoting.
epidemiological studies there, can actually arrive clear numbers
much life one will lose ingesting nicotine way four delivery

thought every pack cigarettes consumed per day, average
two day cigarette smoker pack day cigarette smoker, two pack

interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely

that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding

Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely

people think stage hypnosis, hypnotist trying get people certain

Clinical hypnosis vastly different that. Clinical hypnosis person,
patient actually directs brain changes toward specific emotional behavioral
goal. Work Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory done 1993, now

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain

notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe

right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind

autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high

talking transitioning consumption going call

know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,
homeostatic mechanism brain body sets level mood arousal,
et cetera, not know hasn't adjusted fact not bringing
nicotine. not cigarette. not inhalation vape

offset increases mood alertness, et cetera, smoke vape lower
normally be. 9:00 cigarette time vape inhalation time no
longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate

involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset

smoking vaping, hopefully not waking middle night just
smoke vape. Believe not, people that, course, people
asleep, not smoking vaping. always tell don't fall asleep
cigarette mouth, burn whole house down, exceedingly rare
people smoking sleep. people wake morning
half life nicotine smoking vaping short, anywhere one two

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line
increases morning typically body temperature autonomic
arousal increase. towards afternoon, going come sloping down.
right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call
withdrawal phase. now happens say, it, going cold turkey.
know 5% success rate, going just go cold turkey somebody
will say, no, going use Reveri app. somebody says, no, going use
Bupropion another method nicotine patch something sort. Setting aside
nicotine patch nicotine delivery device focusing approaches
getting withdrawal no direct effects nicotine. not using
nicotine patch, say hypnosis Bupropion, can increase dopamine,
doesn't increase nicotine directly. happens? day quit,
homeostatic mechanism brain body sets level mood arousal,
et cetera, not know hasn't adjusted fact not bringing
nicotine. not cigarette. not inhalation vape
pen. ends happening baseline, adjusted
offset increases mood alertness, et cetera, smoke vape lower
normally be. 9:00 cigarette time vape inhalation time no
longer feels baseline, actually feels baseline seeing
lower amplitude arousal offset increase getting
vaping smoking. afternoon, normally kind phase
afternoon really enjoy, go outside, vape cigarette,
normally feeling relaxed go night like vape say,
nope, not going anymore, going feel much, much worse
would've never started smoking vaping. Now not much help anyone
already started smoking vaping. say important
understand reason relapse rates high within first week, 75%
people relapse within one week overall failure rates 95% people
don't expect feel even worse prior ever smoking vaping.


first week absolutely critical. beauty understanding can get
first week, either sheer grit finding methods increase
dopamine, healthy methods hope, certainly cold showers, ice baths
shown way. described Dr. Anna Lembke's book,
"Dopamine Nation", cold showers can increase dopamine, exercise, positive social
interactions. likely people will need use healthy methods offset
reduction dopamine ever stand get first week. again,
can get first week, chances quite bit higher able
maintain cessation smoking vaping. course, hypnosis, things like
Bupropion, can also assist that, Bupropion way increasing dopamine
pharmacologically, hypnosis changes neural circuitry aren't completely
understood, seem involve remapping so-called default networks
networks involved kind understanding internal
state. stuff gets little bit complicated going return
upcoming episode Huberman Lab Podcast, indeed legitimate
changes neural circuitry caused clinical hypnosis can least partially explain
effective helping treat allow people stop smoking vaping.
that, either saying yourselves, just can't seem quit
smoking vaping dipping snuffing, hopefully understanding
homeostasis process works time course nicotine, depending delivery
device, hopefully understanding will allow develop protocol. Maybe
involves hypnosis. Maybe involves just understanding typical times
ingested nicotine different approaches bringing
system going particularly hard. don't just mean particularly hard. mean,
particularly hard, going need something specific offset
decrease overall autonomic arousal dopamine, et cetera. Hopefully
understanding will allow get first week. can make
past first week, stand good chance never going back. However,
consult Dr. David Spiegel anticipation episode, regardless method
used quit smoking vaping, snuffing, dipping, good evidence
routine maybe month even week hypnosis type approach
replenish even enhance neural circuits allowing stay away
nicotine going good idea. given purely behavioral
intervention, can see no reason people wouldn't want that, go


reinforce, know, tighten bolts circuitry allowing not feel
impulse smoke, not feel impulse vape. just brief mention,
vast literature fact people quit smoking vaping form
consuming nicotine, consume alcohol, much higher probability
relapse. interactions alcohol nicotine cover future
episodes. want quit, want assure you, despite fact
95% people fail, appropriate tools, like think within additional
understanding underlying biology psychology can expect
really dig heels reinforce system dopamine
number different protocols tools offered
can find elsewhere episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
high degree confidence can quit smoking vaping, dipping snuffing.
today, typical frankly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast, covered lot
biology particular system. talked biology nicotine
particular, talked vaping smoking, dipping snuffing negative
health consequences associated those. want reemphasize nicotine not
causes cancer. delivery device causes cancer negative
health effects. not say people ingesting nicotine
different methods simply get cognitive boost. certain circumstances
might appropriate occasional work about, certainly not physical
exercise, given talked earlier, course
approaches increasing, not just nicotine, acetylcholine generally order

like quit thought could. success rate quitting smoking
people try go just cold turkey, just quit no assistance whatsoever. might tell
family friends, hey, quitting, it, exceedingly low, 5%. 5%
people say, it, not smoking again. Despite cancer diagnosis, not

reveri.com, clinical hypnosis approach success rate 23%.

01:36:24 Tool: Nicotine Replacement Schedule Quit Smoking, Nicotine Patch/Gum

closely aligned with, not exceeding success rate Bupropion.
course pharmacologic approaches quitting smoking vaping.
generally circle back increasing dopamine and/or norepinephrine order
offset withdrawal symptoms smoking cessation vaping cessation.
common approach people try quit smoking vaping use nicotine
try prevent people seeking nicotine cigarette vape pen.
mean people using nicotine patch nicotine gum nicotine
delivery device not cigarettes not vaping order maintain levels nicotine
bloodstream, course means maintain levels nicotine brain
body extent smoking vaping, maybe even
gradually taking total amount nicotine brain body reducing
number size nicotine gum pieces ingest day, keeping patch
shorter amount time getting lower dose patch releases less nicotine
total time. approaches shown reasonably
successful, get numbers minutes, reasonably successful allowing
people quit smoking vaping. Again, data cigarette smoking
vaping relatively new phenomenon. Although quite troublingly,
rapidly increasing behavior, especially young population. kind
lumping two things together think soon going need
campaign counter vaping addiction. know smoking
cessation using nicotine itself? patch best? nicotine gum best? Turns
combination approaches best, somewhat surprising, clear
literature able find using nicotine patches period time
switching gum perhaps switching nasal spray, going
effective. question long continue
whether not overlap them. seems one week
switching another week switching another one rationable
reasonable approach many people used successfully. be?
different rates absorption nicotine bloodstream,
downstream consequences dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine,


systems brain body. hasn't extremely
detailed study exact kinetics nasal sprays versus transdermal
patches versus gums, et cetera, work, logical structure will
immediately make sense you. First all, transdermal patches provide fairly
steady state dopamine release across day. oftentimes people wearing
night well. relevant people ingesting nicotine way
smoking vaping, hopefully not waking middle night just
smoke vape. Believe not, people that, course, people
asleep, not smoking vaping. always tell don't fall asleep
cigarette mouth, burn whole house down, exceedingly rare
people smoking sleep. people wake morning
half life nicotine smoking vaping short, anywhere one two
hours, essentially state withdrawal point wake
morning. can say that? Remember, withdrawal sets four hours
last ingestion nicotine cigarette inhalation vape pen. people
waking nicotine withdrawal immediately going behavior
ingesting nicotine, soon waking people. nicotine patch going

approach this, switching nasal spray switching nicotine gum

way a, just call quitting method work. always said,
powerful schedule dopamine going random intermittent reward.
used casinos order take money. generally do,
average, take money take theirs, take it. Not
just often use random intermittent schedule. random
intermittent schedule one don't really know peaks dopamine
going arrive. isn't expectation craving.
sudden dopamine released, extremely high. get
continue playing, even though basically losing money dopamine
dropping, elevate every while. Nicotine replacement can used
similar way, benevolent way, order help get smoking vaping


keeping total amounts dopamine variable around clock changing

01:41:52 Tool: Biological Homeostasis & Nicotine Withdrawal, “First Week” Strategy

don't come expect particular amount dopamine brain
blood given time. important point brings us
notion homeostasis. Homeostasis tendency biological systems try
reach equilibrium. goes up, goes down, et cetera. extent
degree. talk right now context nicotine use withdrawal,
period people no longer crave nicotine. can imagine
measure heart rate, blood pressure, overall levels alertness
wellbeing mood, just give value. say runs zero 10,
again, arbitrary units. just take physiological measures subjected
measure mood. measure four times hour across day, across
waking hours. find line kind squiggle bit, maybe
nice text comes really like, maybe get not good news kind
autonomic arousal place, average kind squiggly line
increases morning typically body temperature autonomic
arousal increase. towards afternoon, going come sloping down.
right sleep, there'll increase again, ever felt kind
run around lot sleep goes down, kind typical contour
autonomic arousal, mood, et cetera, across day, removing course life events
things like psychiatric illness depression et cetera. typical arc that.
Now superimpose whatever contour you, nicotine. get little
bolus say, little bit nicotine smoking cigarette taking
inhalation vape pen, ends happening increase blood
pressure, increase heart rate, increase mood, increase alertness, things
talked earlier. time, body starts adjust baseline upon
nicotine induced increase arousal occur actually reduced, right?
be? Well, body brain, physiology seeks homeostasis.
big increase things like blood pressure mood, et cetera,
typically baseline will drop little bit compensate time, couple


days even weeks ingesting nicotine. say wake up, typically take
inhalation off vape, cigarette around nine 10:00
daily. get used certain level mood alertness wellbeing
time day. smoke afternoon, say also get
accustomed certain level mood alertness wellbeing time day.
Again, it'll vary depending life events, system sort gets used
baseline will drop compensate peaks peaks aren't quite high
first started using nicotine. Now decide quit. now
talking transitioning consumption going call
